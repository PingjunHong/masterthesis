The word \"library\" is an adjective modifying \"steps\", which is a common noun, so removing it doesn't change the fact that the child is on the steps.\n2. The word \"the\" is an article that can be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence, as it is implied in the context.\n3. The sentence \"The child is on the steps\" is a more general statement that can be inferred from the specific location \"library steps\" in the content sentence. \n4.

The highlighted words \"library\" and \"the\" in the content sentence are not essential to the main meaning of the sentence, which is that the child is on the steps. \n6. Omitting the word \"library\" results in a sentence that still conveys the same main action, which is the child being on the steps, and this is an example of entailment. \n7.

The presence of a skier performing an action (\"ski-jumping\") in the Content supports the idea of a skier \"preparing a trick\" in the Statement, as ski-jumping is a form of trick preparation.\n4. The highlighted word index in the Content (2) refers to \"ski-jumping\", which directly relates to the concept of \"preparing a trick\" in the Statement, given that ski-jumping involves preparation and execution of a trick.\n5.
