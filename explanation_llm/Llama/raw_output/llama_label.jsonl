The use of the word \"grin\" instead of a more neutral term like \"smile\" implies a stronger, more intense emotional expression, which is more closely associated with happiness.\n7. Cultural and social norms often associate a big grin with friendliness, approachability, and happiness, making this inference consistent with common social understanding. \n8.
