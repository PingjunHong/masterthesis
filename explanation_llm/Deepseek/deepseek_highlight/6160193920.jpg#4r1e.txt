1. The phrase "very big grin" (indices 11,12 in Content) strongly implies happiness, as a grin is a facial expression typically associated with joy or pleasure.
2. The word "happy" (index 4 in Statement) is directly supported by the description of the woman's facial expression ("very big grin"), which is a clear indicator of happiness.
3. A "grin" is a non-verbal cue for happiness, and the intensifier "very big" further emphasizes the strength of the emotion, making the entailment unambiguous.
4. The absence of any contradictory context (e.g., sarcasm or negative surroundings) in the Content reinforces that the grin genuinely reflects the woman's happiness.
5. The Statement generalizes the observed emotion ("very big grin") to the broader state of being "very happy," which is a logically valid inference.
