1. The content mentions a "group" of football players, implying multiple individuals, while the statement claims there is "only one person."
2. The content refers to "football players" (plural) and a "coaching official," indicating at least two people, contradicting the statement's assertion of a single person.
3. The word "group" in the content inherently suggests more than one person, directly opposing the statement's "only one person."
4. The presence of both "football players" and a "coaching official" in the content means at least two distinct roles exist, conflicting with the statement's singular claim.
5. The statement ignores the collective nouns ("group," "players") in the content, leading to a contradiction with its singular assertion.
