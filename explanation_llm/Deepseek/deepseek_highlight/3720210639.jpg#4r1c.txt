1. The content states the boy is "in midair on bicycle," indicating he is actively riding it, while the statement claims he is "afraid to ride" and lets it "sit in the garage," which contradicts the action shown.
2. The phrase "in midair on bicycle" implies the boy is performing a dynamic action (e.g., jumping or riding), whereas the statement describes a static scenario where the bicycle is unused ("lets it sit in the garage").
3. The content shows the boy engaged with the bicycle (midair motion), while the statement suggests he avoids using it entirely ("afraid to ride"), creating a direct contradiction.
4. The highlighted "in midair on bicycle" confirms the bicycle is in use, conflicting with the statement's claim that it is unused and rusting in the garage.
5. The action of being "in midair on bicycle" cannot coexist with the bicycle being stationary in the garage, making the two descriptions mutually exclusive.
6. The statement's assertion that the boy is "afraid to ride" contradicts the evidence in the content that he is actively riding (midair on bicycle).
7. The bicycle cannot simultaneously be in motion (midair) and stationary (garage), rendering the statement false given the content.
8. The boy's demonstrated skill or confidence in riding (midair) opposes the statement's claim of fear and avoidance.
9. The physical state of the bicycle in the content (in use) directly opposes its described state in the statement (unused, rusting).
10. The temporal inconsistency: the content captures a moment of active riding, while the statement describes a habitual avoidance of riding.
