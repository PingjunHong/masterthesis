1. The statement assumes the man can hear the construction, but the content does not provide any information about his auditory perception or whether the construction noise is audible.
2. The construction site being "next to his building" does not necessarily imply the noise is loud enough to be heard, as distance, soundproofing, or activity level are not specified.
3. The man is described as "talking on the phone" and "working on the laptop," which could mean he is distracted or using headphones, making it uncertain whether he notices the construction noise.
4. The content does not mention any reaction or acknowledgment from the man regarding the construction, leaving his awareness of it ambiguous.
5. The statement introduces a subjective claim ("can hear") that is neither confirmed nor denied by the factual content.
6. The construction site's presence is stated, but no details about noise levels, time of day, or the man's environment (e.g., open windows) are given to support the inference.
7. The man's ability to hear the construction depends on unstated variables (e.g., his hearing ability, the construction's intensity), which the content does not address.
8. The statement extrapolates beyond the given information by asserting a sensory experience (hearing) that is not explicitly described in the content.
