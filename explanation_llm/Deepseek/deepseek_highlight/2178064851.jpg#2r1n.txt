1. The content does not specify the gender of the child, so the statement introduces new information not implied or contradicted by the content.
2. The word "child" is gender-neutral, and the highlighted word "boy" in the statement is neither supported nor contradicted by the content.
3. The statement makes an assumption (the child's gender) that is irrelevant to the described scenario (a wet child in the ocean), leaving the relationship neutral.
4. The content provides no visual or contextual clues (e.g., clothing, pronouns) to confirm or deny the child's gender, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
5. The highlighted word "boy" in the statement is an arbitrary detail unrelated to the core information in the content (the child's location and state), resulting in neutrality.
