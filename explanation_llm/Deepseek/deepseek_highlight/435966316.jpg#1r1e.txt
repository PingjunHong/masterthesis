2. The phrase "three workers" in the content directly corresponds to "three people" in the statement, as both indicate the same quantity.
3. The phrase "on a boat" in the content matches "on a boat" in the statement, confirming the location of the people.
4. The highlighted words in both sentences collectively support the statement's claim about the number and location of the people.
5. The context of the content (workers on a boat) does not contradict the statement's assertion about people being on a boat.
6. The term "workers" is more specific than "people," so if "workers" are present, it logically follows that "people" are present.
