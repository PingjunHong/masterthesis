1. The content does not provide any information about the age of the women, so the statement is neither supported nor contradicted.
2. The word "women" is neutral regarding age; it does not imply youth or old age, leaving the statement unverifiable.
3. The statement introduces new information ("older") that is not addressed or hinted at in the content, making it unrelated.
4. The focus of the content is on the action ("dance in the forest") and attire ("wearing dresses"), not on demographic details like age.
5. The term "older" is subjective and lacks a clear reference point in the content, preventing any inference about its validity.
