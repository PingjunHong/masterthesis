1. "Earthen structure" implies an outdoor or natural setting, which contradicts "office building" as an indoor, man-made environment.
2. "Working with a pickaxe" suggests manual labor typically done outdoors (e.g., construction, mining), while "office building" implies sedentary, white-collar work.
3. The materials and tools mentioned ("Earthen," "pickaxe") are inconsistent with the clean, furnished context of an office.
4. An "Earthen structure" is unlikely to be located inside an "office building" due to spatial and functional incompatibility.
5. The actions described ("working on a structure with a pickaxe") are not activities typically performed in an office setting.
6. The physical environment required for using a pickaxe (e.g., dirt, open space) contradicts the confined, polished space of an office.
7. "Earthen structure" and "office building" represent fundamentally different types of structures (natural vs. urban/commercial).
