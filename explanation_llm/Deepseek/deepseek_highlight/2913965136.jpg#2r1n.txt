1. The content does not provide any information about the boy's age, so the statement is neither supported nor contradicted.
2. The highlighted word "ten" in the statement introduces new information (age) that is unrelated to the action described in the content.
3. The statement makes a specific claim (age) that is not addressed or implied in the content, making it irrelevant to determining truth or falsity.
4. The content describes an action (kicking a soccer ball) that could apply to a child of any age, leaving the statement neutral.
5. There is no logical connection between the action of kicking a soccer ball and the boy being ten years old.
6. The statement is an independent fact that does not interact with the content in a way that would make it entailed or contradicted.
