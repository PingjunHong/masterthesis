1. "Sitting" implies an upright posture with the back not fully reclined, while "lying down" implies a horizontal or reclined posture, which are mutually exclusive in this context.
2. A person cannot simultaneously be in a sitting position and a lying down position while sleeping; these are contradictory physical states.
3. The action of sitting involves bent knees and weight on the buttocks, whereas lying down involves the body being stretched out, making the two descriptions incompatible.
4. The posture described in the content (sitting) does not match the posture in the statement (lying down), creating a direct contradiction in the physical state of the man.
5. Sleeping while sitting typically requires support for the head (e.g., against a wall), while lying down implies full body support on a surface, further highlighting the inconsistency.
