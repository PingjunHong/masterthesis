1. The original content does not mention the direction of the rowboat (e.g., "towards some islands"), so the statement introduces new, unsupported information.
2. The original content does not specify any activity like fishing ("while one of them fishes"), making this part of the statement an unverifiable addition.
3. The presence of seagulls in the content does not imply the specific actions or goals (e.g., rowing towards islands or fishing) described in the statement.
4. The statement assumes intent or purpose (e.g., "rowing towards some islands") that is not evident in the content.
5. The content only describes a scene ("in a rowboat in the ocean") without detailing actions or objectives, leaving the statement's claims neither supported nor contradicted.
