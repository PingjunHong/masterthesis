2. The word "working" in the content (highlighted indices 2,3,4) is a verb indicating an action, which aligns with the verb "working" in the statement (highlighted index 3).
3. The subject "a woman" in the content remains unchanged in the statement, preserving the core meaning that a woman is involved in an activity.
4. The statement generalizes the content by omitting the duration ("long hours"), but the core action ("working") is retained, leading to entailment.
