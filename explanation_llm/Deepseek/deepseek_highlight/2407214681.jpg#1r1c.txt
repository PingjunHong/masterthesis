1. The content specifies the boys are in "blue soccer uniforms," which directly contradicts the statement that they are in "band uniforms."
2. Soccer uniforms and band uniforms are distinct types of attire, making it impossible for the boys to be wearing both simultaneously.
3. The highlighted word "soccer" in the content explicitly describes the type of uniform, leaving no ambiguity that it is not a band uniform.
4. The statement's claim about "band uniforms" introduces an incorrect detail that is not supported by the content.
5. The context of the scene (washing hands in a bathroom) does not align with the typical activities associated with band uniforms, further reinforcing the contradiction.
6. The content provides a clear visual detail (blue soccer uniforms) that directly negates the statement's assertion about the uniforms.
