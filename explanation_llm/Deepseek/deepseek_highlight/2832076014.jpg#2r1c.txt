1. A "land rover" (a type of vehicle) being driven across a river contradicts the idea of a "sedan" (a different type of vehicle) being stuck in the same river, as they cannot both be true simultaneously.
2. The "land rover" is actively moving ("being driven"), while the "sedan" is immobile ("stuck"), creating a contradiction in the state of the vehicles in the river.
3. The presence of a "land rover" crossing the river implies the river is passable, which contradicts the "sedan" being stuck, suggesting the river is impassable.
4. The two vehicles ("land rover" and "sedan") are distinct and cannot occupy the same scenario in a logically consistent way, leading to a contradiction.
5. The action of driving across the river (by the land rover) conflicts with the sedan being stuck, as one implies successful traversal while the other implies failure.
