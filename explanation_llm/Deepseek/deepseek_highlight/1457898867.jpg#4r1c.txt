1. The content states there are **two cows**, which contradicts the statement's claim of **a single cow**.
2. The content describes the cows as being near the boy (**between two cows**), implying they are not **alone**, which contradicts the statement.
3. The presence of **a boy riding** near the cows means the cows are not isolated, conflicting with the idea that the cow is **alone**.
4. The statement's use of **single cow** ignores the fact that the content explicitly mentions **two cows**, creating a direct numerical contradiction.
5. The term **alone** in the statement suggests solitude, but the cows in the content are in proximity to each other and the boy, making the statement false.
