1. The highlighted word "running" in the content contradicts the highlighted words "riding bikes" in the statement, as running and biking are different actions.
2. The content describes the ladies as engaged in the activity of running, while the statement claims they are engaged in biking, which cannot be true simultaneously.
3. The action of running (from the content) is mutually exclusive with the action of riding bikes (from the statement), making the two descriptions contradictory.
4. The presence of "running" in the content directly negates the possibility of the ladies "riding bikes" as stated, since one cannot run and ride a bike at the same time in this context.
5. The physical activity described in the content ("running") is incompatible with the activity described in the statement ("riding bikes"), creating a clear contradiction.
