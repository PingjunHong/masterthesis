1. "Four adults" contradicts "Two couples" because two couples would imply four people, but the activities (eating vs. playing pool) and settings (tile floor vs. bar) are incompatible.
2. "Eat while sitting on a tile floor" contradicts "play pool in a bar" because the actions and locations cannot logically occur simultaneously.
3. The number of people (four adults) matches numerically (two couples = four people), but the described scenarios are mutually exclusive.
4. The activities ("eat" vs. "play pool") are fundamentally different and cannot be true at the same time for the same group.
5. The settings ("tile floor" vs. "bar") are spatially and contextually inconsistent with each other.
6. The implied social context (casual eating on the floor vs. recreational pool in a bar) contradicts each other in tone and purpose.
7. The physical postures (sitting on the floor vs. standing/moving around a pool table) are incompatible.
8. The highlighted indices (4 vs. 2) do not resolve the contradiction, as the core conflict lies in the actions and settings, not the numbers.
