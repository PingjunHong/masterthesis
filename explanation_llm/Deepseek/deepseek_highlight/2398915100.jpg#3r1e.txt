1. The highlighted words in the Content ("Men", "sit", "bus") directly correspond to the highlighted words in the Statement ("Men", "sit", "bus"), preserving the core meaning.
2. The Statement is a simplified version of the Content, omitting non-essential details ("wearing blue uniforms") while retaining the key elements ("Men", "sit", "bus").
3. The presence of "Men" and "sit" in both sentences, along with the shared context of a "bus", ensures the Statement logically follows from the Content.
4. The Statement captures the main action ("sit") and subject ("Men") from the Content, and the location ("bus") is unchanged, making the entailment valid.
5. Removing the descriptive phrase "wearing blue uniforms" does not alter the truth of the Statement, as the remaining highlighted words still align with the Content.
6. The Statement’s highlighted words form a subset of the Content’s highlighted words, and this subset is sufficient to establish entailment.
7. The Content provides additional information about the men (uniforms), but the Statement’s assertion about men sitting on the bus remains true regardless.
8. The semantic relationship between the highlighted words in both sentences is preserved, ensuring the Statement is entailed by the Content.
