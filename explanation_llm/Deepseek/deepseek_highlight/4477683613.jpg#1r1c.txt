1. The content mentions "pedestrians" but does not mention "motorcyclists," so the presence of motorcyclists is neither confirmed nor contradicted.
2. The statement introduces new information ("motorcyclists") that is unrelated to the content's focus on "pedestrians," making it neither supported nor opposed.
3. The content describes a general scene ("crowded city street") without specifying the types of vehicles or people present, leaving the statement's claim about motorcyclists unverifiable.
4. The highlighted word "motorcyclists" in the statement is not addressed in the content, creating no direct relationship between the two.
5. The statement could be true or false independently of the content, as the content does not provide evidence for or against the presence of motorcyclists.
