1. The content states the gymnast is already being coached on bar skills, implying she is at the gym, while the statement claims she is on her way to the gym.
2. "Being coached on bar skills" indicates the gymnast is actively training, which contradicts the idea of her still traveling ("on her way") to the gym.
3. The highlighted "on bar skills" in the content confirms the gymnast is engaged in an activity at the gym, while "on her way" in the statement suggests she has not yet arrived.
4. The gymnast cannot simultaneously be receiving coaching at the gym and be en route to the gym.
5. The action of coaching ("being coached") requires the gymnast to be present at the gym, which conflicts with the statement's assertion that she is in transit ("on her way").
