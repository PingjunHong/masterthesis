1. "Two men" implies at least two individuals, which satisfies "some people" (typically meaning at least one or more).
2. The presence of "men" (a subset of "people") in the content confirms the existence of "people" in the statement.
3. The shared phrase "in a boat" establishes the same location, making the scenario consistent.
4. The quantifier "some" is non-specific and can encompass the explicit number "two" mentioned in the content.
5. The statement does not contradict the content; it generalizes the specific information ("two men") to a broader category ("people").
6. The highlighted word "men" (content) and "people" (statement) are semantically related, as "men" are a subset of "people."
7. The statement’s claim is weaker (less specific) than the content, so the content’s specificity supports the statement’s generality.
