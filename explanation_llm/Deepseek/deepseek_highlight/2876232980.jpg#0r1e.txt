1. The highlighted words in the **Content** ("child", "wearing", "red", "top", "standing", "behind", "blond", "headed", "child") are all present in the **Statement** in the same order and context, confirming the entailment.
2. The **Statement** is a subset of the **Content**, omitting only non-highlighted words ("is", "a", "sitting", "in", "a", "wheelbarrow"), which do not affect the truth of the entailment.
3. The core meaning of the **Content**—that a child in red is standing behind a blond child—is fully preserved in the **Statement**, as all key elements (highlighted words) are retained.
4. The **Statement** does not introduce any new information or contradict the **Content**, ensuring the entailment holds.
5. The syntactic and semantic relationships between the highlighted words (e.g., "child wearing a red top," "standing behind," "blond headed child") are identical in both sentences, supporting entailment.
6. The removal of non-highlighted words in the **Statement** does not alter the logical necessity of the **Content** implying the **Statement**.
7. The **Statement** captures all essential predicates (e.g., "wearing," "standing," "headed") and arguments (e.g., "child," "red top," "blond child") from the **Content**, ensuring entailment.
