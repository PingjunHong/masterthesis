1. The original content does not mention the purpose of digging (e.g., "for gold"), so the statement introduces new, unsupported information.
2. The word "gold" in the statement is speculative and not implied or stated in the content, making the claim neither entailed nor contradicted.
3. The content only describes the action of digging without specifying intent, so the statement’s added detail ("for gold") cannot be verified.
4. The statement assumes a motive ("for gold") that is not present or inferable from the content, leaving it neutral.
5. The highlighted word "gold" introduces an unsubstantiated goal, which the content neither confirms nor denies.
6. The statement extends the content with an arbitrary reason for digging, which is not logically derivable from the given information.
7. The content’s neutrality is preserved because the statement’s additional detail ("for gold") is neither explicitly supported nor contradicted.
