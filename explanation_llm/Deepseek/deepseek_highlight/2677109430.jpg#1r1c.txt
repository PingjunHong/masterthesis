1. The content specifies the choir sings **at a church**, while the statement claims they sing **at a baseball game**, which are different locations.
2. The content mentions the choir sings **joyous songs from the book**, implying a religious setting, whereas the statement suggests a secular event (**baseball game**), creating a contradiction.
3. **A church** and **a baseball game** are mutually exclusive contexts for a choir’s performance in this scenario.
4. The highlighted parts (**at a church** vs. **at a baseball game**) directly oppose each other in terms of venue and likely purpose.
5. The content’s setting (**church**) contradicts the statement’s setting (**baseball game**), making the two scenarios incompatible.
