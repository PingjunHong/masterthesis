1. "Having a great time looking for seashells" implies the girls are actively engaged in an activity, while "taking a nap" suggests they are asleep and inactive.

3. The girls cannot simultaneously be actively searching for seashells and sleeping, as these actions are mutually exclusive.
4. "Great time" suggests excitement or enjoyment, which is incompatible with the restful state of napping.

6. The highlighted words ("looking" vs. "nap") directly oppose each other in terms of energy and activity level.
