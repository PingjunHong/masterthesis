1. The highlighted word "black" in the content contradicts the highlighted word "purple" in the statement, as they describe different shirt colors.
2. The content specifies that the group of people is wearing black shirts, which implies the driver (as part of the group) is also wearing a black shirt, not purple.
3. The statement claims the driver's shirt is purple, but the content provides no evidence of any non-black shirts, making the statement inconsistent.
4. If the driver were wearing a purple shirt, it would mean not everyone in the group is wearing black, which contradicts the content's assertion about the group's attire.
5. The content's description of the group's clothing ("black shirts") excludes the possibility of the driver wearing a purple shirt, as no exceptions are mentioned.
