1. "sit against a wall" implies "lean against a wall" as both describe a similar resting position against a surface.
2. "homeless men" in the content matches "homeless men" in the statement, confirming the subject.
3. "with a sleeping dog" entails "with a dog" because the presence of the dog is preserved regardless of its state (sleeping).
4. The leash color ("purple") is irrelevant to the statement, so its omission doesn’t affect entailment.
5. The number "two" is consistent in both sentences, ensuring the quantity of men is unchanged.
6. "dressed in gray" is omitted in the statement, but clothing details don’t contradict the core claim about the men and the dog.
7. The spatial relationship ("against a wall") is identical in both sentences, maintaining the same scene setup.
