1. The word "obstacle" in the content implies a dry or land-based setting, while "pool" in the statement suggests a water-based environment, which contradicts the context.
2. Jumping over an obstacle typically occurs on solid ground, not in a pool where movement is restricted by water.
3. A dog jumping over an obstacle is an active, land-based action, whereas being in a pool implies the dog is submerged or swimming, creating a contradiction.
4. The presence of an obstacle suggests a dry, structured course (e.g., agility training), incompatible with the unstructured, watery setting of a pool.
5. "Obstacle" and "pool" describe mutually exclusive environments for the described action (jumping), making the statement contradictory.
6. A dog cannot simultaneously be jumping over an obstacle (requiring solid footing) and be in a pool (where footing is unstable or absent).
7. The physical act of jumping over something is inconsistent with the buoyant, submerged state implied by being in a pool.
