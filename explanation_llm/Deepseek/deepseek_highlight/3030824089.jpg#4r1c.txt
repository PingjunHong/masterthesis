1. "Runs" implies the dog is moving quickly with a running gait, while "walking" implies a slower, more leisurely movement, which are mutually exclusive actions.
2. The dog cannot simultaneously be running and walking at the same time, as these are distinct modes of locomotion.
3. The speed and manner of movement described by "runs" (fast, dynamic) directly contradicts the description of "walking" (slow, steady).
4. The physical state of the dog in the content (running) is incompatible with the state described in the statement (walking).
5. The actions "runs" and "walking" represent different levels of exertion and motion, making them contradictory in this context.
