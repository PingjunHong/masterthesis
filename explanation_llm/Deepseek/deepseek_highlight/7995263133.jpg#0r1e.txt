1. The highlighted word "pillow" in the Content directly matches the highlighted word "pillow" in the Statement, confirming the boy is sleeping on a pillow.
2. The Content describes the boy "lying down in bed and sleeping," which implies he is resting on a pillow, as pillows are commonly used for sleeping in beds.
3. The Content specifies the pillow is "colorful striped," which is a type of pillow, further supporting the Statement's claim about the boy sleeping on a pillow.
4. The presence of "pillow" in both sentences establishes a direct lexical overlap, reinforcing the entailment.
5. The action of "sleeping" in the Content logically involves the use of a pillow, making the Statement's claim a necessary inference.
6. The boy's posture ("lying down") and the mention of a bed contextually imply the use of a pillow, even if not explicitly stated in the Statement.
7. The Statement generalizes the specific description of the pillow in the Content ("colorful striped") to the broader category "pillow," which is valid for entailment.
