1. "Tending to a garden" (Content) involves outdoor plant care, while "cooking dinner" (Statement) is an indoor kitchen activityâ€”the actions are mutually exclusive.
2. "Older woman" (Content) is gardening, not performing the unrelated action of "cooking" (Statement).
3. Gardening (Content) requires physical presence outside, making it impossible to simultaneously "cook dinner" (Statement) indoors.
4. The roles described ("tending" vs. "cooking") are distinct and cannot logically occur at the same time in the given context.
