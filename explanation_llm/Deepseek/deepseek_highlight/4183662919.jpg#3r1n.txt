1. The addition of "while he is at work" introduces new information not present in the content, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted by the content.

5. The content is consistent with the statement but does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the father's presence or absence at work.

7. The statement's added detail does not change the truth value of the original content, maintaining neutrality.
8. The content and statement describe compatible scenarios, but the statement's additional information does not derive from the content.
