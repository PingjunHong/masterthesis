1. The word "approaching" in the content implies that the wave is coming towards the boys, which aligns with the statement's description of the wave as "about to crash," indicating imminent impact.
2. The word "wave" in the content is specified as "giant" in the statement, but both describe a large body of water moving towards the boys, preserving the core meaning.
3. The phrase "four boys" in the content is generalized to "some boys" in the statement, which is logically consistent as "some" can include the specific number four.
4. The action "hit by an approaching wave" in the content is rephrased as "crash on some boys" in the statement, both conveying the same event of the wave striking the boys.
5. The temporal aspect "about to be hit" in the content matches "about to crash" in the statement, confirming the immediacy of the event.
6. The highlighted words "approaching" (content) and "crash" (statement) are semantically related, as an approaching wave logically leads to a crash.
7. The word "giant" in the statement is an elaboration on the implied size of the "wave" in the content, but does not contradict the original meaning.
8. The passive construction "are about to be hit" (content) and active construction "is about to crash" (statement) describe the same scenario from slightly different perspectives without altering the entailment.
