1. The content does not mention the boy's hair length, so "long-haired" in the statement introduces new, unverifiable information.
2. The content does not specify the speed of the skateboard, making "at a fast pace" an unsupported addition.
3. The statement uses "his" to imply ownership of the skateboard, which is not indicated in the content.
4. The highlighted parts in the statement ("long-haired," "at a fast pace," "his") are not contradicted by the content but are not confirmed either, resulting in neutrality.
5. The core elements (boy, skateboard, stone wall, graffiti) align, but the added details in the statement neither entail nor contradict the content.
