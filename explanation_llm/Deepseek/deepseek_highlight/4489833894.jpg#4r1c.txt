1. The highlighted word "throws" in the content implies action, while "sitting" in the statement suggests inactivity, creating a contradiction.
2. A player actively throwing the ball cannot simultaneously be sitting on a bench, making the scenarios mutually exclusive.
3. The content describes a dynamic interaction (throwing), whereas the statement describes a static state (sitting), which cannot both be true at the same time.
4. The action of throwing requires the player to be standing or moving, directly conflicting with the seated position described in the statement.
5. The two scenarios (active play vs. passive sitting) represent opposing states of engagement in the game, leading to a logical contradiction.
