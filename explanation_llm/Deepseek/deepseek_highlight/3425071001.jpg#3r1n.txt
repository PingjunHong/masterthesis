1. The action of hitting a tennis ball does not inherently imply skill or proficiency in tennis.
2. The statement assumes the boy's ability ("good at tennis") without evidence from the content (e.g., accuracy, technique, or outcome of the hit).
3. The content only describes a single action ("hits a tennis ball"), which is insufficient to judge overall competence in the sport.
4. "Good at tennis" is a subjective evaluation, while the content provides an objective observation with no evaluative context.
5. The highlighted words in the statement ("good," "tennis," "boy") introduce new information (skill level) not implied by the content.
6. Neutrality arises because the content neither supports nor contradicts the claim about the boy's tennis ability.
7. The statement generalizes from a specific action to a broader skill, which is not logically entailed by the content.
8. The content lacks details (e.g., frequency of play, match results) that could validate or refute the boy's proficiency.
