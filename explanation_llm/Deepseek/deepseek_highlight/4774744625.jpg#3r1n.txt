2. The highlighted words "having a conversation" introduce new information not present in the content.
3. The content only describes the men sitting, not their actions or interactions.
4. The statement assumes an activity (conversation) that is not supported by the content.

6. The content is purely descriptive, while the statement makes an inference about behavior.
7. The statement could be plausible but is not confirmed by the content.
