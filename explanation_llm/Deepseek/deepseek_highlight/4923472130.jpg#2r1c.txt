1. The content states the shirt is red, while the statement claims it is green, which are different colors.
2. "Red" and "green" are mutually exclusive color descriptions for the same shirt.
3. The highlighted words in the content ("red shirt") directly contradict the highlighted words in the statement ("green shirt").
4. There is no overlap or synonymy between "red" and "green" in this context.
5. The statement introduces a fact (green shirt) that cannot be true if the content (red shirt) is true.
6. The color discrepancy makes the two descriptions logically incompatible.
7. The assertion of a green shirt negates the explicit mention of a red shirt in the content.
8. No interpretation allows for a shirt to be both red and green simultaneously in this scenario.
