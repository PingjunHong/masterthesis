1. The statement generalizes "Ford car" to "sedan," which is a broader category and does not contradict the content.
2. "Making a right turn" is paraphrased as "turning a corner," which is a neutral rephrasing without changing the meaning.
3. "3 males" is generalized to "walkers," which is neutral as it does not misrepresent the group.
4. "Walking across the street behind the car" is simplified to "crossing," which retains the core action without altering the meaning.
5. The highlighted words in the statement ("sedan," "turning a corner," "walkers") do not introduce any conflicting or unsupported information compared to the content.
6. No additional assumptions or inferences are made in the statement that go beyond the content.
7. The temporal relationship ("as") between the car turning and the walkers crossing is preserved, maintaining neutrality.
