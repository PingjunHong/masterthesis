1. The **"frowning old man"** does not necessarily imply anger; he could be expressing sadness, concentration, or another emotion.
2. The **"military cap"** does not confirm the man is a veteran; it could be a costume, a fashion choice, or unrelated to service.
3. The **"civilian suit"** contrasts with military attire, weakening the claim he is a veteran.
4. The crowd's purpose (protesting war) is not explicitly stated in the content; they could be celebrating, rallying for another cause, or in a parade.
5. The man **"stands amongst"** the crowd but is not described as actively watching or reacting to them, making the statement speculative.
6. The **"balloons"** suggest a non-hostile or festive atmosphere, which conflicts with the idea of an angry protest.
7. The statement assumes intent (e.g., "watches as people protest"), while the content only describes a scene without clear action or motive.
