- The content states the men are "homeless," which directly contradicts the statement that they "own homes."
- "Homeless" implies they do not have homes, while "own homes" asserts they do.
- The presence of a "sleeping dog on a purple leash" suggests transient living conditions, reinforcing their homelessness, which contradicts home ownership.
- The description of the men sitting "against a wall" aligns with homelessness, not home ownership.
- The word "homeless" in the content explicitly negates the possibility of the men owning homes as claimed in the statement.
- The statement's assertion of home ownership is incompatible with the contextual details (e.g., sitting against a wall, leash) that imply lack of permanent housing.
