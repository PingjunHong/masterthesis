1. The content states the people are "on the edge of the roof," while the statement claims they are "climbing down the ladder," which are two different actions.
2. Being "on the edge of the roof" implies they are stationary or preparing to jump, not actively descending a ladder.
3. The content does not mention a ladder at all, making the statement's claim about climbing down one unsupported.
4. "Looking up at 3 people on the edge" suggests the people are visible and not in the process of descending, contradicting the statement.
5. If the people were climbing down a ladder, they would likely not be fully visible on the roof's edge as described in the content.
6. The actions described ("on the edge" vs. "climbing down") are mutually exclusive in this context.
7. The statement introduces a ladder, which is not referenced or implied in the content, creating a contradiction.
