- "Some dogs" implies multiple dogs, while "only one dog" specifies a single dog, creating a numerical contradiction.
- The presence of multiple dogs ("some dogs") directly contradicts the claim that there is "only one dog."
- "Running" (plural action) suggests more than one dog, conflicting with the singular "one dog."
- "Some" indicates an unspecified plural quantity, which cannot align with the exact singular quantity "one."
- The statement negates the possibility of multiple dogs, which is asserted in the content.
- The highlighted words ("some dogs" vs. "one dog") represent incompatible quantifiers.
- The content describes a group activity ("running"), which is inconsistent with a solitary dog.
