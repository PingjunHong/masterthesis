1. "Legos" (from the content) and "chess" (from the statement) are different activities, implying the boys cannot be doing both simultaneously in the given context.
2. The highlighted word "Legos" in the content refers to a building toy, while the highlighted word "chess" in the statement refers to a board game, creating a direct contradiction in the described actions.
3. Playing with Legos involves constructing or assembling, whereas playing chess involves strategic gameplay, making the two activities mutually exclusive in this scenario.
4. The content specifies the boys are engaged in a physical, creative activity (Legos), while the statement claims they are engaged in a mental, rule-based game (chess), which cannot both be true at the same time.
5. The objects involved ("Legos" vs. "chess") are fundamentally different, leading to a contradiction in the description of the boys' actions.
