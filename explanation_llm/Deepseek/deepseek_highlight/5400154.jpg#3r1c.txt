1. The content states the men are in a boat, while the statement claims they are on a car, which are two different locations.
2. "Boat" and "car" are contradictory objects; one is a water vehicle, the other is a land vehicle.
3. The content specifies "two men," while the statement uses "some men," which could imply a different number.
4. Standing "in a boat" is not the same as standing "on top of a car," as the spatial relationships differ.
5. The actions (standing in vs. standing on top of) describe incompatible scenarios.
6. The highlighted words ("boat" and "car") refer to entirely distinct objects, making the situations mutually exclusive.
7. The statement introduces a new object (car) not mentioned in the content, creating a contradiction.
8. The content describes a specific scene (men in a boat), while the statement describes an unrelated scene (men on a car).
