1. "Everyone on the street... busy doing their own thing" implies the people are occupied with personal tasks, while "The people are watching what is happening" suggests they are observing others, which contradicts being busy with their own activities.
2. "Busy doing their own thing" indicates a lack of attention to external events, whereas "watching what is happening" implies active observation of surroundings, creating a contradiction.
3. If people are focused on their own tasks (Content), they cannot simultaneously be actively watching events (Statement), as these actions are mutually exclusive in this context.
4. The Content describes disengagement from the environment ("busy doing their own thing"), while the Statement asserts engagement ("watching what is happening"), leading to a direct contradiction.
5. The highlighted words "busy doing their own thing" conflict with "watching," as the former suggests inward focus and the latter outward attention.
6. The Statement assumes collective attention ("The people are watching"), but the Content describes individual preoccupation ("Everyone... busy"), making the two scenarios incompatible.
7. "Busy" implies distraction or lack of awareness, while "watching" requires attentiveness, resulting in a logical inconsistency.
8. The Statement implies passivity or observation, whereas the Content emphasizes active involvement in personal tasks, creating a contradiction in behavior.
9. The Content suggests people are ignoring their surroundings, while the Statement claims they are actively monitoring them, which cannot both be true simultaneously.
10. The two statements describe opposing states of attention: one focused internally ("their own thing") and the other externally ("watching what is happening"), leading to a clear contradiction.
