1. The content does not mention any person who almost hit the taxi cab, so the statement introduces new, unsupported information.
2. The statement assumes intent ("screaming at the person"), while the content only describes the action of screaming without specifying a target.
3. The highlighted words in the statement ("at the person that almost hit her taxi cab") add a causal relationship not present in the content.
4. The content describes the child screaming while sticking her head out of the taxi, but it does not link the screaming to an external event like an almost-accident.
5. The statement infers a specific reason for the screaming, while the content provides no context for why the child is screaming.
6. The highlighted part of the statement introduces an external actor (the person) and an event (almost hitting the cab), neither of which are mentioned in the content.
7. The content is purely observational (a child screaming), while the statement interprets the observation with additional assumptions.
8. The statement's added details ("at the person that almost hit her taxi cab") are not entailed by the content and are not contradicted either, making the label neutral.
