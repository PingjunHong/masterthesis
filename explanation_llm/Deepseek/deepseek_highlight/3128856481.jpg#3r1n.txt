1. The **white duck** is not a rare breed, contradicting the claim that it is thought to have been driven into extinction.
2. The duck **expanding its wings in the water** is a common species, not one considered extinct.
3. The description of the duck as **white** and **in the water** suggests it is a typical, non-extinct breed, conflicting with the statement.
4. The actions of the duck (**expanding its wings**) are ordinary behaviors of living ducks, not consistent with an extinct species.
5. The presence of the duck in a natural setting (**in the water**) implies it is not a rare or extinct breed.
6. The highlighted words in the statement (**rare breed**, **extinction**) are contradicted by the observable, non-exceptional traits of the duck in the content.
