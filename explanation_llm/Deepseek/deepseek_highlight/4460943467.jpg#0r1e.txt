1. "3 young man" in the content corresponds to "Three hood wearing people" in the statement, where "three" and "people" generalize "3 young man."
2. "in hoods" in the content aligns with "hood wearing" in the statement, both describing the attire of the individuals.
3. "standing in the middle of a quiet street" in the content is paraphrased as "stand in a street" in the statement, omitting "middle" and "quiet" but preserving the core spatial relationship.
4. The statement simplifies the content by removing details like "young," "facing the camera," and "quiet," while retaining the essential meaning.
5. The core action ("standing"/"stand") and location ("street") are preserved between the two sentences.
6. The plural subject ("man" as "people") and their description ("hoods"/"hood wearing") are logically equivalent in context.
7. The statement generalizes "young man" to "people," which is valid since "young man" is a subset of "people."
8. The spatial preposition "in" (content) and "in" (statement) maintain the same locative relationship.
