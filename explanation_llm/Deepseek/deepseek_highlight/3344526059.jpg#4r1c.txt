1. The highlighted word "helmet" in the content implies the player is actively engaged in play or practice, not resting.
2. The highlighted words "taking rest" in the statement directly conflict with the active state suggested by wearing a helmet in hockey.
3. A hockey player wearing a helmet is typically in motion or prepared for action, which contradicts the idea of resting.
4. The presence of a helmet indicates the player is involved in a game or training, making the claim of resting inconsistent.
5. Resting players would not be wearing protective gear like helmets, as they are not actively playing.
6. The action implied by "helmet" (playing hockey) is mutually exclusive with the state of "taking rest."
7. Hockey players remove helmets when resting, so the combination of wearing a helmet and resting is contradictory.
8. The statement assumes inactivity ("rest"), while the content shows readiness for activity ("helmet"), creating a contradiction.
