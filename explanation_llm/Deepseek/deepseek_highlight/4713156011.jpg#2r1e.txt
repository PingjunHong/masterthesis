1. "A man" and "a guy" are synonymous in this context, both referring to a male individual.
2. "Flung himself" and "hurled himself" convey the same action of throwing oneself forcefully.
3. "Over a pole" implies movement "in the air," as going over a pole requires being airborne.
4. The specific details about "people and canopies in the background" do not contradict the statement, as they are additional context not relevant to the core action.
5. The core action (a man throwing himself into the air) is preserved in both sentences, making the entailment valid.
6. The highlighted words in both sentences describe the same subject ("man"/"guy") and the same action ("flung"/"hurled").
7. The spatial relationship ("over a pole") inherently involves being "in the air," reinforcing the entailment.
8. No contradictory information exists between the content and the statement regarding the action or subject.
