1. The word "gliding" introduces new information (motion) not implied or contradicted by the original content, which only describes a static scene ("on a wide plain").
2. The original content does not specify whether the snowboarder is moving or stationary, making the addition of "gliding" neither supported nor contradicted.
3. "Gliding" is a plausible action for a snowboarder on snow, but its absence in the original content prevents entailment or contradiction.
4. The statement adds detail ("gliding") that is consistent with but not derivable from the original content, resulting in neutrality.
5. The original contentâ€™s lack of action-related terms ("on a wide plain") leaves the dynamic state of the snowboarder undefined, making the statement neutral.
