1. The content does not specify the breed of the dog, so the statement about it being a chihuahua cannot be confirmed or denied.
2. The highlighted word "chihuahua" introduces new information not present or implied in the content, making the statement neither supported nor contradicted.
3. The dog's breed is irrelevant to the description in the content, so the statement does not logically follow or conflict with it.
4. The content focuses on the scene and actions (e.g., sitting, holding a sign) rather than the dog's specific attributes like breed.
5. The statement is an independent observation about the dog's breed, which does not alter or relate to the factual claims in the content.
