1. The highlighted words "volleyball" in the Content and "soccer" in the Statement are distinct sports, making the Statement an entailment because volleyball is not soccer.
2. The action "playing volleyball" in the Content implies a specific sport, which logically excludes the possibility of it being soccer, as highlighted in the Statement.
3. The word "volleyball" in the Content directly contradicts the notion of "soccer" in the Statement, leading to entailment due to mutual exclusivity of the sports.
4. The Statement's negation ("doesn't look like") is supported by the Content's explicit mention of "volleyball," which is not soccer.
5. The semantic difference between "volleyball" and "soccer" in the highlighted words ensures the Statement is entailed by the Content.
6. The Content's description of the activity ("playing volleyball") provides sufficient evidence to conclude the Statement ("not soccer") is true.
7. The highlighted terms represent incompatible activities, making the Statement a valid inference from the Content.
8. The absence of any reference to soccer in the Content, combined with the presence of "volleyball," justifies the entailment of the Statement.
9. The Statement's focus on "soccer" is irrelevant to the Content's focus on "volleyball," reinforcing the entailment through contrast.
10. The explicit mention of a non-soccer sport in the Content makes the negation in the Statement ("doesn't look like soccer") necessarily true.
