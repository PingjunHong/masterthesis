1. "Flapping its wings on the water" implies the bird is on or near the water surface, while "flying over the trees" suggests it is airborne and above trees, which are typically not on water.
2. "On the water" indicates the bird is in contact with or close to water, contradicting "over the trees," which implies elevation and distance from water.
3. "Flapping its wings on the water" could describe a bird taking off or landing, not actively flying high enough to be "over the trees."
4. "Flying over the trees" requires the bird to be at a significant height, inconsistent with "on the water," which suggests a low or ground-level position.
5. The actions described ("flapping on the water" vs. "flying over trees") occur in mutually exclusive locations (water vs. forest/land).
6. "On the water" typically describes aquatic birds or behaviors like swimming, which are incompatible with sustained flight "over the trees."
7. The highlighted phrases describe spatially incompatible scenarios: one grounded/near water, the other airborne/above land.
8. "Flapping its wings on the water" may imply the bird is struggling or stationary, while "flying over the trees" implies forward motion and altitude.
