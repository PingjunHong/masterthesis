1. The highlighted words in the Content ("child", "does", "jumping") directly correspond to the key elements in the Statement ("child", "does", "jumping kick"), preserving the core action and subject.
2. The phrase "a child does a jumping kick" is a simplified version of the Content, omitting only the non-essential detail ("in a ninja outfit"), which does not affect the truth of the Statement.
3. The action "does a jumping kick" in the Statement is explicitly confirmed by the same phrase in the Content, and the subject "child" is unchanged.
4. The Statement captures the main event (a child performing a jumping kick) without requiring the additional context of the ninja outfit, making the entailment valid.
5. The highlighted words in both sentences align semantically, with no contradictory or conflicting information, ensuring the Statement logically follows from the Content.
