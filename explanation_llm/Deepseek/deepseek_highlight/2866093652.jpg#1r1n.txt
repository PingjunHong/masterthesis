1. The statement adds the subjective interpretation "enjoying," which is not necessarily implied by the original content (competitive rollerskating does not always equate to enjoyment).
2. The original content describes the women as "competitively rollerskating," which suggests a focus on competition rather than enjoyment.
3. The statement omits the competitive aspect, altering the original meaning and making the relationship neutral rather than entailed.
4. The word "enjoying" introduces a positive emotional state that is not explicitly stated or supported by the original content.
5. The original content is purely descriptive (actions observed), while the statement infers an emotional state, leading to a lack of direct alignment.
