3. The child being "wet" in the content suggests engagement in water-related activities, which aligns with the idea of "playing" in the statement.
4. Standing in "chest deep" water implies the child is actively in the water, supporting the notion of playful behavior ("playing").
5. The general scenario of a child in ocean water is highly consistent with beach activities, making the entailment plausible.
6. The absence of contradictory information in the content allows for the interpretation that the child is playing, even if not explicitly stated.
7. The word "ocean" in the content naturally implies a beach setting, reinforcing the entailment of the statement.
