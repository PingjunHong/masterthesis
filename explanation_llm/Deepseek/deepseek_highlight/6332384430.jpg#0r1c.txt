1. The highlighted word "black" in the content refers to the man's race, not his belt color, while "blackbelts" in the statement refers to a rank in martial arts, creating a contradiction.
2. The content specifies the belts are red and blue, not black, directly contradicting the statement's claim that the men are "blackbelts."
3. The term "blackbelts" implies a high martial arts rank, but the content only describes the men practicing, not their rank, leading to a lack of evidence for the statement.
4. The statement assumes the men's belt colors indicate rank, but the content explicitly describes their belts as red and blue, making the claim false.
5. The highlighted word "black" in the content is unrelated to the martial arts context, while "blackbelts" in the statement is martial arts-specific, causing a semantic mismatch.
