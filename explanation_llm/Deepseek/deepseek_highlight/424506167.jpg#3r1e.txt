1. "stand side by side" implies physical proximity, which aligns with "standing together" as both indicate the dogs are close to each other.
2. The phrase "side by side" suggests a shared location or alignment, which is consistent with the idea of "together" in the statement.
3. The action of standing "side by side" inherently means the dogs are in the same place at the same time, matching the description of "standing together."
4. Both "side by side" and "together" convey a sense of unity or companionship between the dogs in the yard.
5. The spatial relationship described by "side by side" is a specific instance of the more general concept of "together," making the statement entailed.
6. The highlighted words in the content ("stand side by side") provide sufficient evidence to infer that the dogs are "standing together" in the statement.
7. The meaning of "side by side" is a subset of the meaning of "together," ensuring the entailment holds.
8. The context of the yard remains unchanged, and the core action (standing) is preserved, with "side by side" reinforcing the idea of "together."
9. The statement simplifies the description without altering the core meaning, as "together" captures the essence of "side by side."
10. The entailment is valid because the spatial configuration implied by "side by side" logically satisfies the condition of being "together."
