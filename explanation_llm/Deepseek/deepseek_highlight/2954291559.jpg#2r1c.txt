1. The content specifies a "worker," implying employment, while the statement refers to an "unemployed person," which directly contradicts the employment status.
2. The content describes someone actively engaged in construction ("atop a building under construction"), further confirming they are employed, whereas the statement assumes unemployment.
3. The highlighted "worker" in the content explicitly denotes a job role, while the highlighted "unemployed person" in the statement negates any job association.
4. The context of construction work in the content suggests the person is currently working, making the claim of unemployment in the statement inconsistent.
5. The term "worker" inherently conflicts with "unemployed," as the former requires employment and the latter explicitly denies it.
