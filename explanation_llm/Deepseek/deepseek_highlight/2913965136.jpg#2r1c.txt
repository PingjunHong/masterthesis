1. "Gets ready to kick" implies the boy is awake and active, while "sleeping" implies he is unconscious and inactive.
2. "Soccer ball" suggests an outdoor or physical activity, which contradicts "at home" if interpreted as a passive, indoor state.
3. "Kick the soccer ball" indicates movement and engagement, directly opposing the static state of "sleeping."
4. The boy cannot simultaneously be preparing to kick a ball (active) and be asleep (inactive).
5. "Gets ready" implies intentional action, which is incompatible with the unconscious state of sleeping.
6. The locations implied by the activities (outdoor for soccer vs. indoor for sleeping) may conflict if the scenarios are mutually exclusive.
7. The temporal context of "gets ready" (present action) contradicts the continuous state of "sleeping" (ongoing inactivity).
8. The roles of the boy (active participant vs. passive sleeper) are mutually exclusive in the given contexts.
