1. The statement introduces a specific location ("factory") not mentioned or implied in the content, making it neither entailed nor contradicted.
2. The content does not provide any information about the setting or type of work, so the statement's addition of "factory" is an unsupported detail.
3. "Working long hours" (content) is compatible with many work environments, including a factory, but the content does not confirm or deny this.
4. The statement narrows the scope of the content by specifying a factory, but the content remains too vague to align or conflict with this detail.
5. Neutrality arises because the content neither supports nor opposes the idea of the woman working in a factory; it is simply silent on the matter.
