1. The content does not specify what is being sold at the street market, so the mention of "fruits" in the statement introduces new, unsupported information.
2. The statement narrows the scope of the market to selling fruits, while the content only broadly mentions "shopping" without detailing the items.
3. The highlighted words "fruits" in the statement are not contradicted by the content, but they are also not confirmed, making the relationship neutral.
4. The content's generality ("shopping") allows for the possibility of fruits being sold, but it does not explicitly state it, resulting in neutrality.
5. The statement adds a specific detail ("fruits") that is neither implied nor excluded by the content, leading to a neutral inference.
