5. The content lacks any details about the children's actions beyond lying near the bricks, making the claim in the statement neither supported nor contradicted, hence neutral.

7. The content does not describe any interaction between the children and the bricks that would imply construction, only their passive presence.
8. The statement assumes a creative or functional use of the bricks (a furnace), while the content only describes their spatial arrangement, leaving their purpose ambiguous.
9. The highlighted words in the statement ("brick furnace") introduce a new object not present in the content, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
10. The content’s description of the bricks as "wooden" does not align with the statement’s implication of a "brick furnace," as wooden bricks are unlikely to be used for such a purpose.
