1. The content states the man is wearing a **gray** ball cap, while the statement claims it is a **blue** cap.
2. The color **gray** in the content directly contradicts the color **blue** in the statement.
3. The highlighted word **gray** in the content and **blue** in the statement cannot both be true simultaneously for the same cap.
4. The statement incorrectly describes the color of the cap, which is explicitly stated as **gray** in the content.
5. The contradiction arises from the mismatch in color attributes (**gray** vs. **blue**) of the cap worn by the man.
