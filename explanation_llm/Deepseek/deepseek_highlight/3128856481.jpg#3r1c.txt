1. The content describes the duck "expanding its wings," which implies activity, while the statement says it "sleeps soundly," implying inactivity.
2. "Expanding its wings" suggests the duck is awake and moving, contradicting the idea of it "sleeping."
3. The content shows the duck in an active state ("expanding its wings in the water"), while the statement describes a passive state ("floating on top of the water").
4. The duck cannot be simultaneously expanding its wings (an active behavior) and sleeping soundly (a passive behavior).
