1. The content states they are "standing on a pier," which contradicts being "in a boat."
2. A pier is a stationary structure on land or over water, while a boat is a moving vessel, making the locations mutually exclusive.
3. The presence of a "table" and "glasses" on the pier suggests a fixed setting, not a boat.
4. Boats typically do not have piers inside them, so being on a pier rules out being in a boat.
5. The foreground objects (table, glasses) imply stability, which is inconsistent with the movement or environment of a boat.
6. "Standing" on a pier implies solid ground, whereas being in a boat would involve a floating or unstable surface.
7. The two scenarios (pier vs. boat) describe physically distinct and incompatible locations.
