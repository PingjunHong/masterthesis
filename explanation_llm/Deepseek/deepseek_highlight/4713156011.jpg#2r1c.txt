1. The highlighted words "flung himself" in the content describe an action of jumping or throwing oneself, which contradicts the action of "running after" in the statement.
2. The content describes the man being stationary (flung over a pole), while the statement implies he is in motion (running).
3. The action "flung himself over a pole" suggests a vertical or stationary movement, whereas "running after a robber" implies horizontal movement.
4. The content does not mention a robber or any context of pursuit, making the statement's claim unsupported.
5. The man's action in the content (flinging over a pole) is unrelated to chasing someone, creating a contradiction with the statement's scenario.
6. The highlighted parts in the content focus on the man's position relative to a pole, while the statement focuses on a dynamic chase, leading to inconsistency.
7. The statement introduces a new entity (robber) not present in the content, creating a contradiction due to the lack of evidence.
8. The content implies the man is engaged in an acrobatic or static act, while the statement suggests a completely different activity (pursuit).
