1. The word "group" implies multiple people, while "no one" asserts the absence of any people dancing.
2. "Dancing together" indicates an activity involving people, whereas "no one is dancing" denies any such activity.
3. The presence of "a group of people" contradicts the claim "no one" because a group cannot exist if there are zero individuals.
4. The action "dancing" in the content is directly negated by "no one is dancing" in the statement.
5. The plural "people" in the content conflicts with the singular/zero implication of "no one" in the statement.
6. The collective activity ("dancing together") is incompatible with the absolute negation of any activity ("no one is dancing").
