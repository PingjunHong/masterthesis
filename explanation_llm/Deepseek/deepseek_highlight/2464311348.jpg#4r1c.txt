1. "prepare a fish" implies the men are already handling a caught fish, while "with their fishing poles" suggests they are still fishing and have not caught anything yet.
2. "at a dock" indicates the men are on a stationary structure, whereas "in a canoe" implies they are on a moving boat.
3. The actions described ("prepare a fish" vs. "sitting with fishing poles") are incompatible—one involves post-catch activity, the other pre-catch activity.
4. The locations ("dock" vs. "canoe") are mutually exclusive—they cannot be on a dock and in a canoe simultaneously.
5. The highlighted parts describe two different scenarios: one where the men have finished fishing and are processing the fish, and another where they are actively fishing.
