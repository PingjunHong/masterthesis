1. "Six rescuers cooperate to place an injured man on a transport device" contradicts "six people get ready to eat a seventh who is injured" because the first describes a rescue effort while the second describes cannibalism.
2. "Place an injured man on a transport device" contradicts "eat a seventh who is injured" because the actions (helping vs. harming) are opposite in intent.
3. "Rescuers" contradicts "get ready to eat" because rescuers are helpers, not aggressors.
4. "Cooperate" contradicts "get ready to eat" because cooperation implies teamwork for a positive goal, not harming someone.
5. "Snowy, mountainous terrain" is irrelevant to the act of cannibalism described in the statement, creating a contradiction in context.
6. The entire scenario of rescue in harsh conditions contradicts the absurd and violent scenario of eating an injured person.
7. The highlighted words in the content ("rescuers," "cooperate," "place," "transport device") all imply aid, while the highlighted words in the statement ("get ready to eat") imply harm.
8. The injured man being helped in the content contradicts the injured person being a victim of cannibalism in the statement.
9. The number "six" is consistent, but their roles (rescuers vs. aggressors) are contradictory.
10. The purpose of the group's actions (saving a life vs. taking a life) is directly opposed.
11. The content describes a professional, organized effort, while the statement describes a barbaric act, making the scenarios incompatible.
