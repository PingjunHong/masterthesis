1. The term "newlywed" implies the couple has recently married, which contradicts the idea of them being divorced.
2. A divorced couple would not typically be described as "laughing and talking amongst themselves" in the context of a recent marriage.
3. The statement "The couple is divorced" directly negates the state of being newly married, as suggested by "newlywed."
4. The action of "laughing and talking amongst themselves" suggests a positive, ongoing relationship, inconsistent with divorce.
5. Divorce legally ends a marriage, making it impossible for a "newlywed couple" to simultaneously be divorced.
