1. The original content does not specify whether the steps are inside or outside the library, leaving the location ambiguous.
2. The statement introduces new information ("inside the library") that is not present or implied in the content, making it neither supported nor contradicted.
3. The content only describes the child's location relative to "library steps," which could refer to steps leading to, from, or near the library, not necessarily inside it.
4. The statement's addition of "inside" is an unverifiable detail based on the content, resulting in a neutral relationship.
5. The content and statement describe similar but not identical spatial relationships, with the statement being more specific without evidence in the content.
6. The highlighted word "inside" in the statement is an inference that goes beyond the information provided in the content, creating neutrality.
