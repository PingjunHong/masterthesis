1. The highlighted words "making a snow angel" (13,11,12,14) in the Content imply that the girl is engaged in an activity ("plays") involving snow, which aligns with the Statement's "plays in the snow" (6,3,4,5).
2. The Content describes the girl as being dressed for outdoor weather (red coat, blue head wrap, jeans), which supports the Statement's claim that she is "outside" (3).
3. The action "making a snow angel" (13,11,12,14) inherently requires snow, directly entailing the Statement's "in the snow" (4,5).
4. The girl's activity ("making a snow angel") is a playful one, which matches the Statement's verb "plays" (6).
5. The Subject "girl" in both sentences is consistent, and the Content's description of her actions and attire logically supports the Statement's broader assertion about her being outside and playing in the snow.
