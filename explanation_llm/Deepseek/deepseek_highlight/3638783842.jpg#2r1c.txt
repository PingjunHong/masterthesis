1. "Formally dressed" contradicts "long-haired" if formal attire implies neatly styled or tied-up hair, making long, loose hair unlikely.
2. "Bald" directly contradicts "long-haired" as baldness implies the absence of hair.
3. "Older women" contradicts "young women" due to the age difference implied by the terms.
4. The number "two" in both sentences is consistent, but the descriptions of the women (appearance and age) are mismatched.
5. The combination of "bald" and "long-haired" is impossible, as one cannot be both bald and have long hair simultaneously.
6. "Formally dressed" may imply a professional or conservative appearance, which could conflict with the casual connotation of "long-haired" in certain contexts.
7. The term "older" suggests maturity or advanced age, while "young" explicitly indicates youth, creating a direct contradiction.
8. The physical description in the content (bald, older) is incompatible with the statement's description (long-haired, young) in every aspect except the count ("two").
