1. The statement specifies "indoors," but the content does not mention the location, leaving it ambiguous.
2. The term "children" in the statement is broader than "little kids" in the content, but the difference is minor and does not contradict.
3. The word "shirtless" in the statement aligns with "without shirts" in the content, but the phrasing is slightly different without changing the meaning.
4. The statement does not explicitly mention "facing each other," but this detail does not contradict the content.
5. The core meaning of both sentences (children sitting without shirts) is preserved, with no significant additions or contradictions.
