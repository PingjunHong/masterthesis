1. The word "pretty" is subjective and introduces an evaluative judgment not present in the original content.
2. The original content does not describe the blond-headed child's appearance beyond hair color, making the addition of "pretty" an unsupported elaboration.
3. The neutrality of the original statement is disrupted by the inclusion of an opinion ("pretty"), which is not factual or observable.
4. The highlighted word introduces bias or personal interpretation, which is absent in the neutral description of the original content.
5. The statement adds an unnecessary qualifier ("pretty") that does not alter the factual relationship between the children but introduces non-neutral sentiment.
