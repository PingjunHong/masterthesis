1. The content states the man is "sitting," which directly contradicts "pacing" as sitting implies being stationary while pacing implies movement.
2. The content describes the man as "talking on the phone" and "working on the laptop," which suggests he is engaged in calm activities, contradicting the nervous pacing described in the statement.
3. The highlighted word "sitting" in the content indicates a relaxed posture, while "pacing" implies agitation or restlessness, creating a contradiction in the man's behavior.
4. The man's multitasking (sitting, talking, working) in the content implies focus or composure, which is inconsistent with the nervous energy implied by "pacing" in the statement.
5. The physical state of sitting (content) and pacing (statement) cannot occur simultaneously, making the two descriptions mutually exclusive.
