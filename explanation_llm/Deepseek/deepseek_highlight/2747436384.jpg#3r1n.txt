1. "A group of people" is more general than "boys," which specifies gender, making the statement broader and not fully aligned with the content.
2. "Play in the ocean" implies active engagement, while "with their backs against an incoming wave" describes a passive or defensive stance, lacking clear evidence of playful activity.
3. The content does not confirm whether the boys are "playing" or simply standing in the water, leaving the statement neither supported nor contradicted.
4. The term "ocean" is not explicitly mentioned in the content (only "wave" is referenced), introducing uncertainty about the setting.
5. The statement assumes intent ("play") that is not verifiable from the content, which only describes a physical posture.
6. The number of individuals ("a group") is vague and may not precisely match the unspecified number of "boys" in the content.
