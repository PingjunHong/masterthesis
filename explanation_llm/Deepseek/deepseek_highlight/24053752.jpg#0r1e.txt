1. "A person in a red shirt" (Content) entails "A person in red" (Statement) because wearing a red shirt implies the person is in red.
2. "mowing the grass" (Content) entails "cutting the grass" (Statement) because mowing is a specific way of cutting grass.
3. "with a green riding mower" (Content) entails "on a riding mower" (Statement) because using a riding mower implies being on it.
4. The actions and objects described in the Content (person, red, grass, riding mower) are all present in the Statement, preserving logical consistency.
5. The omission of "shirt" (Content) in the Statement does not change the meaning, as "in red" still correctly refers to the person's attire.
6. The omission of "green" (Content) in the Statement does not affect the entailment, as the color of the mower is irrelevant to the action.
7. The reordering of words (e.g., "riding mower" in Content vs. "mower" in Statement) does not alter the core meaning.
8. Both sentences describe the same core event: a person performing grass-cutting using a riding mower while wearing red.
