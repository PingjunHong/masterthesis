1. The word "passes" in the content indicates an act of sharing, while "refusing to share" in the statement directly contradicts this action.
2. The content describes a cooperative interaction ("passes a blue ball"), whereas the statement claims the opposite ("refusing to share").
3. The highlighted word "passes" implies willingness to share, which conflicts with the highlighted words "refusing to share" in the statement.
4. The action of passing the ball between the dogs demonstrates sharing behavior, which is negated by the statement's assertion that they are refusing to share.
5. The content's description of the dogs' interaction ("passes a blue ball") is incompatible with the statement's claim of non-cooperation ("refusing to share").
