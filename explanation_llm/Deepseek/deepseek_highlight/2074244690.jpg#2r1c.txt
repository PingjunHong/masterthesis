1. The highlighted word "watching" in the Content implies the group is awake and engaged in an activity, while "asleep" in the Statement directly contradicts this state.
2. The Content describes an active event ("gathered at night watching"), which is incompatible with the passive state of being asleep in the Statement.
3. "Watching an event" requires consciousness and attention, which cannot occur if the group is asleep as stated.
4. The group's activity in the Content (observing an event) is temporally inconsistent with the Statement's claim that they are asleep at the same time.
5. The Statement's "asleep" negates the implied alertness in the Content's "watching," creating a direct logical opposition.
6. The Content's scenario (people gathered for an event) suggests social interaction, which is impossible if the group is asleep as per the Statement.
7. The temporal context ("at night") in the Content does not override the contradiction, as "watching" still requires wakefulness, unlike "asleep."
8. The Statement's assertion of sleep eliminates the possibility of the group performing any observable action like "watching" in the Content.
9. The highlighted words represent mutually exclusive states: one cannot simultaneously be asleep and actively watching something.
10. The Content's description of collective activity ("gathered... watching") is invalidated by the Statement's claim of inactivity ("asleep").
