1. The highlighted word "singing" in the content contradicts "reciting poetry" in the statement, as they describe different actions (singing vs. reciting).
2. The content describes a musical performance ("singing"), while the statement describes a literary performance ("reciting poetry"), creating a contradiction in the type of activity.
3. The action "singing" implies vocalizing with melody, whereas "reciting poetry" implies speaking rhythmically without musical accompaniment, leading to a mismatch.
4. The content specifies an auditory performance involving music ("singing"), while the statement specifies a non-musical verbal performance ("reciting"), which cannot both be true simultaneously.
5. The highlighted words represent incompatible artistic expressions (singing as a musical act vs. poetry recitation as a spoken-word act), making the statements contradictory.
