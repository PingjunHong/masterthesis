6. If the side of the road were empty, there would be no men sitting there, which contradicts the content.
7. The content provides evidence (men sitting) that disproves the statement's assertion of emptiness.
8. The existence of any objects or people on the side of the road (e.g., men) makes the statement "empty" false.
