1. "Standing" implies a stationary position, while "walk" implies movement, creating a contradiction.
2. "Lift" suggests the workers are on a platform or elevated structure, whereas "home" implies they are leaving the workplace, which contradicts their location.
3. The workers cannot simultaneously be "standing on a lift" and "walking home" at the same time.
4. The action of "standing" is incompatible with the action of "walking" in the same context.
5. The location "on a lift" conflicts with the direction "home," as the latter implies movement away from the workplace, not remaining on equipment.
6. The temporal aspect is contradictory: "standing" suggests a current state, while "walk home" implies a subsequent action that cannot occur simultaneously.
