1. The **woman** in the content is not explicitly identified as the **mother** of the boy, so the relationship is assumed but not confirmed.
2. The **boy** in the content is not explicitly identified as the **son** of the woman, leaving the familial relationship unverified.
3. The content describes a general scene with multiple bike riders, and the statement introduces a specific familial relationship that is not supported by the original text.
4. The highlighted words in the statement (**mother**, **son**) introduce assumptions not present in the content, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
5. The content only provides observable details (e.g., "woman," "boy") without inferring relationships, while the statement adds unsupported interpretations.
