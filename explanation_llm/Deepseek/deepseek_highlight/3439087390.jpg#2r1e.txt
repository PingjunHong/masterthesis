1. The word "dogs" (index 6,8 in Content) refers to animals, and "nap" (index 11 in Content) implies they are asleep, which aligns with "ANIMALS ARE ASLEEP" (indices 1,3,2 in Statement).
2. "A bunch of dogs" (indices 6,8 in Content) is a subset of "ANIMALS" (index 1 in Statement), and "take a nap" (index 11 in Content) means they are asleep, satisfying the Statement.
3. The phrase "dogs take a nap" (indices 6,8,11 in Content) directly corresponds to "ANIMALS ARE ASLEEP" (indices 1,3,2 in Statement) because dogs are animals and napping is a state of sleep.
4. The Statement's "SOME ANIMALS" (indices 1,2 in Statement) is justified by "a bunch of dogs" (indices 6,8 in Content), and "ARE ASLEEP" (index 3 in Statement) is supported by "take a nap" (index 11 in Content).
5. The Content describes dogs (animals) napping (sleeping), which is a specific instance of the general claim in the Statement that some animals are asleep.
