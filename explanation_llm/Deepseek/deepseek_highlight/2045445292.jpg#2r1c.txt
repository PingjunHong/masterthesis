1. The content describes the men **working to saw a log**, while the statement claims they are **having a beer**, which are mutually exclusive activities.
2. **Sawing a log** requires physical effort and focus, making it unlikely the men would simultaneously be **having a beer**.
3. The statement implies a relaxed social activity (**having a beer**), whereas the content describes labor-intensive work (**saw a log**).
4. The two actions (**work to saw a log** vs. **having a beer**) cannot logically occur at the same time for the same subjects.
5. The highlighted parts describe incompatible scenarios—productive labor versus leisure—creating a direct contradiction.
