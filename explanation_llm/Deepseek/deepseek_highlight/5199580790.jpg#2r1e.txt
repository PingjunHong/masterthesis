1. The highlighted "Three men" in the Content implies "Some people" in the Statement, as three men are a subset of "some people."
2. The action "carrying a red bag into a boat" in the Content aligns with "put something in a boat" in the Statement, as carrying implies placing or putting.
3. The phrase "another person and boat in the background" in the Content supports "a place with more than one boat" in the Statement, confirming multiple boats are present.
4. The general scenario described in the Content (people moving an object into a boat) logically entails the broader claim in the Statement (people putting something in a boat).
5. The highlighted "people" in the Statement is justified by the presence of "three men" and "another person" in the Content, collectively representing "some people."
6. The existence of at least two boats (one being entered and one in the background) in the Content satisfies the condition "more than one boat" in the Statement.
