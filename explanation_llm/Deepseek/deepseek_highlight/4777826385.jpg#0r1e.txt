1. The highlighted words in the Content ("leans against a pedestal outside of") imply that the man is leaning in an outdoor location near a building, which directly supports the Statement's claim that he "leans outside a building."
2. The phrase "outside of an ornate building" in the Content includes the key spatial relationship ("outside") that aligns with the Statement's assertion of leaning "outside a building."
3. The action of leaning (highlighted in both sentences) is described in a way that preserves the core meaning (location relative to a building) despite additional details in the Content.
4. The Statement simplifies the Content by omitting details (e.g., "against a pedestal," "ornate") but retains the essential spatial entailment ("outside a building").
5. The highlighted words in the Content ("outside of") explicitly confirm the Statement's highlighted words ("outside"), making the directional relationship unambiguous.
6. The building's description ("ornate") in the Content does not contradict the Statement's generic reference to "a building," allowing the entailment to hold.
7. The Statement's assertion is a subset of the information in the Content, with no conflicting details, ensuring logical consistency.
