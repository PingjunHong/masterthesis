1. The content does not mention a "duck," only a "bird," so the statement introduces new information not present in the content.
2. The content describes the bird "flapping its wings on the water," which does not confirm or contradict the statement's claim that the duck is "swimming in the lake."
3. "Flapping its wings on the water" is not equivalent to "swimming," as the actions are distinct behaviors.
4. The location "on the water" in the content is not explicitly the same as "in the lake" in the statement.
5. The statement assumes the bird is a duck, but the content does not specify the type of bird.
6. The content and statement describe different actions (flapping vs. swimming) without clear overlap or contradiction.
7. The statement could be true or false independently of the content, as the content does not provide enough information to infer a relationship.
