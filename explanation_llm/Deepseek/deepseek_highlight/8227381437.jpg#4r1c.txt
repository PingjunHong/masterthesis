1. An old shoemaker is unlikely to be celebrating a 16th birthday, as "old" implies advanced age.
2. A 16th birthday is typically associated with youth, which contradicts the description of the shoemaker as "old."
3. The word "old" suggests the shoemaker has lived many years, making a 16th birthday implausible.
4. Celebrating a 16th birthday would imply the shoemaker is a teenager, conflicting with the term "old."
5. The age implied by "old" is incompatible with the age implied by "16th birthday."
6. A shoemaker described as "old" would have had many birthdays before the 16th, making the statement illogical.
7. The phrase "16th birthday" suggests a young person, while "old" explicitly contradicts this.
8. An "old" individual would have already passed their 16th birthday long ago.
9. The numerical age (16) does not align with the qualitative descriptor ("old").
10. The statement ignores the implication of "old," which would place the shoemakerâ€™s age far beyond 16.
