1. The content describes a group of cleaners performing a mundane task (sweeping animal feces), while the statement describes a supernatural event (a man walking on water), which is impossible in reality.
2. The highlighted words in the content ("group," "sweeping," "feces") refer to a collective, physical activity involving dirt, whereas the highlighted words in the statement ("man," "walking," "water") describe an individual performing an impossible action, creating a direct contradiction.
3. The content involves a realistic, everyday scenario (cleaners working during a parade), while the statement presents a biblically or mythologically improbable act, making them mutually exclusive.
4. The actions in the content (sweeping feces) and the statement (walking on water) are fundamentally incompatibleâ€”one is grounded in reality, the other defies physical laws.
5. The subjects differ: the content refers to multiple people ("group of cleaners") engaged in labor, while the statement focuses on a single person ("man") performing a miraculous feat.
6. The settings conflict: the content occurs in a public, festive context (parade/festival), while the statement lacks context but implies an unnatural phenomenon unrelated to the scene described.
7. The highlighted words in the content emphasize a dirty, practical task, while those in the statement suggest purity and impossibility, reinforcing the contradiction.
