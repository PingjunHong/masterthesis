1. "Stands" (Content) and "sits" (Statement) describe mutually exclusive postures; one cannot stand and sit simultaneously.
2. "Arms spread" (Content) implies an upright posture, while "sits crosslegged" (Statement) requires a seated position, creating a physical contradiction.
3. The spatial configuration of "stands with arms spread" (Content) is incompatible with the folded posture of "sits crosslegged" (Statement).
4. The verb "stands" (Content) denotes vertical positioning, whereas "sits" (Statement) denotes horizontal positioning relative to the floor, making the actions contradictory.
5. The described actions (standing vs. sitting) require entirely different body orientations, preventing both from being true at the same time.
