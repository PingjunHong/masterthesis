1. The content does not specify the exact number of players on each team, only that there are two teams competing.
2. "12 ladies" is an assumption not confirmed by the content, which only mentions "two women's volleyball teams" without stating team sizes.
3. Volleyball teams can vary in size (e.g., 6 players per team in standard play), so "12 ladies" may not align with the actual number described.
4. The content focuses on the teams and setting, not the precise count of players, leaving the statement unsupported.
5. The highlighted "12" in the statement introduces new information not present or implied in the content.
6. The statement generalizes the number of players, while the content remains ambiguous about the total count.
