1. "Homeless man" contradicts "rich man" because they represent opposite socioeconomic statuses.
2. "Pushes an overfilled plastic blue shopping cart" contradicts "holding a Rolex" because the former suggests poverty while the latter suggests wealth.
3. A homeless man is unlikely to own or hold a Rolex, making the two scenarios mutually exclusive.
4. The actions described (pushing a shopping cart vs. holding a Rolex) are inconsistent with each other in terms of lifestyle and financial means.
5. The visual imagery of a homeless man with a shopping cart is incompatible with that of a rich man with a luxury watch.
6. The two descriptions imply vastly different living conditions that cannot logically coexist in the same context.
7. A rich man would not typically be pushing a shopping cart, especially one associated with homelessness.
8. The highlighted words emphasize opposing economic realities, making the statement a direct contradiction.
