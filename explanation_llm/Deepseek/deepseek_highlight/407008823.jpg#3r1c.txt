1. "Jump" implies an upward or leaping motion, while "slide" implies a smooth, downward or gliding motion, which are contradictory actions.
2. Performing a "jump" over a crevasse requires active effort and tension on a rope, whereas "sliding" suggests passive movement on a slide, making the scenarios incompatible.
3. A "rope" is used for climbing or swinging, while a "slide" is a fixed structure designed for descending, making the described methods of crossing the crevasse contradictory.
4. The physical mechanics of "jumping" on a rope (e.g., dynamic tension) conflict with the mechanics of "sliding" (e.g., frictionless descent), rendering the two actions mutually exclusive.
5. The highlighted words describe fundamentally different modes of movement ("jump" vs. "slide") that cannot logically occur simultaneously in the same context.
