1. "Escalator" (Content) and "elevator" (Statement) refer to different modes of transportation—one is a moving staircase, the other is a closed cabin that moves vertically.
2. The Content describes people using an escalator (implied to be moving continuously), while the Statement claims they are using an elevator (which operates differently).
3. The highlighted words "escalator" and "elevator" are mutually exclusive in this context—people cannot simultaneously be on both.
4. The action of "waiting to get to their destination" on an escalator contradicts the idea of "taking the elevator," as elevators typically involve entering and exiting a confined space.
5. The visual context (looking outside through glass walls) is more consistent with an escalator's open structure than an elevator's enclosed design.
6. The Statement misrepresents the mode of transport described in the Content, creating a direct contradiction.
