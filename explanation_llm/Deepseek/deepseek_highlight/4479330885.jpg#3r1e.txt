1. The word "outside" does not contradict or strongly support the original content, as sitting in front of a statue could imply being outside, but it is not explicitly confirmed.
2. The original content does not specify whether the setting is indoors or outdoors, making "outside" neither confirmed nor denied.
3. The term "outside" is too general and does not provide enough specific information to align or conflict with the original content.
4. The original content focuses on the presence of a statue, while the statement introduces the concept of being "outside," which is unrelated to the main focus of the content.
5. The word "outside" does not add any new information that would change the interpretation of the original content, maintaining a neutral relationship.
6. The original content could be interpreted as either indoors or outdoors (e.g., a statue in a museum or a park), leaving the statement's "outside" as a possible but unverified scenario.
7. The statement's use of "outside" does not explicitly conflict with the original content, nor does it provide additional evidence to support it.
8. The highlighted word "outside" is not directly addressed or implied in the original content, resulting in a neutral inference.
