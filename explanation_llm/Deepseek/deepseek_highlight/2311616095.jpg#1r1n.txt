1. The content does not mention the man's marital status or whether he has a wife, so the statement about surprising his wife is unsupported.
2. The content does not indicate that the man's actions are intended as a surprise, making the statement speculative.
3. The statement assumes the man is cooking for his wife, but the content does not specify who the meal is for.
4. The highlighted words "his wife" introduce new information not present in the content, leading to neutrality.
5. The content describes a general cooking scenario, while the statement adds a specific motive (surprising his wife) without evidence.
6. There is no indication in the content that the man's cooking is unusual or unexpected, which would be necessary to infer a "surprise."
7. The statement infers a relationship (husband-wife) and intent (surprise) that are not implied by the content.
8. The highlighted words "going to" suggest future intent, but the content only describes an ongoing action without explicit future implications.
