1. The highlighted word "library" in the content is a modifier specifying the type of steps, but the core meaning ("on the steps") is preserved in the statement.
2. The statement generalizes the content by omitting the specific location ("library"), but the key spatial relationship ("on the steps") remains unchanged.
3. "Library steps" is a subset of "steps," so if the child is on the library steps, they are inherently on steps.
4. The removal of "library" does not contradict the statement; it only makes it less specific, maintaining logical consistency.
5. The predicate "on the steps" in the statement is fully supported by the predicate "on the library steps" in the content.
6. The semantic overlap between "library steps" and "steps" ensures the entailment holds, as the latter is a broader category encompassing the former.
7. The statement captures the essential action and location ("on the steps") from the content, disregarding the non-essential detail ("library").
8. The relationship between "child" and "steps" is unchanged in both sentences, satisfying entailment.
9. The highlighted words in the content ("library steps") and statement ("steps") share a hyponym-hypernym relationship, ensuring entailment.
10. The statement’s assertion is weaker (less specific) than the content’s, so the content logically implies the statement.
