1. The content does not specify the type of dance, so "tango" could be correct but is not confirmed.
2. The statement introduces new information ("tango") that is not implied or contradicted by the content.
3. The content only describes a general activity (dancing), while the statement narrows it to a specific dance style, making it neither entailed nor contradicted.
4. The highlighted words ("the tango") are not inferable from the content alone, as the dance style is unspecified.
5. The statement could be true or false based on the content, as the content is too vague to determine the accuracy of the claim.
6. The content and statement are compatible but not logically connected, as the content does not provide enough detail to support or refute the statement.
