- The child cannot be sleeping if the adults are looking down at them in the bath, as this implies the child is awake and active.
- "Looking down at the child" suggests the child is visibly engaged or moving, which contradicts the idea of them being asleep.
- A sleeping child would not require or prompt adults to stand around observing them in the bath.
- Bathing typically involves interaction or supervision of an awake child, not a sleeping one.
- The action of "looking down" implies the child is in a state that warrants attention, which is unlikely if they are asleep.
- If the child were sleeping, they would likely be lying still or not visibly active, making the adults' observation unnecessary or unusual.
