1. "Icy road" contradicts "dry highway" because ice implies wet or slippery conditions, while "dry" implies the absence of moisture.
2. "Road" and "highway" are not necessarily the same location; a road can be distinct from a highway in terms of size, usage, or context.
3. The presence of ice ("icy road") suggests cold or winter conditions, while a "dry highway" could imply warmer or non-winter conditions, creating a temporal or environmental contradiction.
4. Walking "down an icy road" implies a specific hazardous condition, while "near the dry highway" suggests a safer or different setting, which may not align.
5. The two descriptions ("icy road" vs. "dry highway") cannot simultaneously be true for the same location under normal circumstances.
