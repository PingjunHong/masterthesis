1. "Walk" implies movement, while "set down" implies stopping or sitting, which are contradictory actions.
2. "Walk down the street" suggests continuous motion, whereas "set down in the street" suggests a stationary position.
3. "Set down" typically means placing something or sitting, which contradicts the active motion of "walking."
4. The phrase "set down" does not align with the progressive action described by "walk," creating a logical inconsistency.
5. "Walk" involves moving forward, while "set down" involves coming to rest, making the two actions mutually exclusive.
6. The verb "walk" cannot coexist with "set down" in the same context without contradiction, as they describe opposing states of motion.
7. "Set down" implies a deliberate cessation of movement, conflicting with the ongoing action of "walking."
8. The physical act of walking cannot logically occur simultaneously with setting down in the same space and time.
