1. The presence of people on a pier does not inherently imply they are going fishing; they could be engaging in other activities (e.g., sightseeing, socializing, or waiting for a boat).
2. The statement assumes intent ("going fishing") without any explicit evidence in the content (e.g., fishing equipment, boats, or related actions).
3. The highlighted word "They" is ambiguous; the content does not specify who "they" refers to or their purpose.
4. The content mentions objects like a table and glasses, which are unrelated to fishing, further weakening the connection.
5. The statement introduces new information (fishing) not supported or contradicted by the content, making it neutral rather than entailed or contradictory.
