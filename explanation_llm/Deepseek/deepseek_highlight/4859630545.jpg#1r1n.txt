1. The word "judges" introduces an interpretation of the woman's behavior that is not supported by the content, which only states she "walks by them."
2. The content does not provide any information about the woman's thoughts or feelings, making the claim of her judging them an unwarranted assumption.
3. The neutral stance arises because the content is purely descriptive, while the statement adds a subjective layer ("judges") not present in the original.
4. The highlighted words ("walks by and judges") conflate observable action ("walks by") with inferred intent ("judges"), which lacks evidence in the content.
5. The statement introduces a negative connotation ("judges") that is absent in the neutral description of the scene in the content.
6. The content is fact-based (actions only), while the statement includes speculative or evaluative language ("judges"), creating a mismatch.
7. The neutrality is preserved in the content because it avoids attributing motives or emotions to the woman, unlike the statement.
