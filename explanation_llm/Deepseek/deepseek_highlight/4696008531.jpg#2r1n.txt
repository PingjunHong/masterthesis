1. The content does not specify the target of the throw (e.g., "his son"), making the statement an unsupported elaboration.
2. The highlighted word "son" introduces new information not present or implied in the content, rendering the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
3. The action of throwing could be directed at anyone or anything; the statement assumes a specific recipient without evidence.
4. The content only describes an attempt to throw, not a confirmed successful throw, while the statement assumes the action is completed.
5. The relationship between the man and the recipient ("his son") is purely speculative based on the given content.
6. Neutrality arises because the statement adds details (the son) that are compatible with but not derivable from the content.
