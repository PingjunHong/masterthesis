1. "An old man" implies "A man" (the statement generalizes the age descriptor).
2. "package" is not necessary for the entailment, as the core action ("poses") is preserved.
3. "poses" in the content directly matches "poses" in the statement.
4. "in front of" is identical in both sentences, preserving the spatial relationship.
5. "an advertisement" is synonymous with "an ad," maintaining the same referent.

7. The statement is a simplified version of the content, retaining only the key components needed for entailment.
8. The action ("poses") and location ("in front of an ad") are sufficient to infer the statement from the content.
9. Non-highlighted words in the content (e.g., "with a") do not contradict or weaken the entailment.
10. The statementâ€™s structure aligns with the core proposition of the content, ignoring optional modifiers.
