3. The word "puppies" in the content is directly referenced in the statement, reinforcing the connection between the two sentences.
4. The presence of "puppies" in both sentences and the implied care ("nurses") in the content logically entail the scenario described in the statement.

7. The statement generalizes the specific action in the content ("nurses") to a broader scenario ("next to their mother"), which is entailed by the content.
