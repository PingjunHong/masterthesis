1. The content does not mention the presence of friends, so the statement introduces new information ("with his friends") that is not implied or supported by the content.
2. The action of shooting a gun is described in both, but the context (e.g., whether it is recreational or not) is not specified in the content, making the addition of "with his friends" neither supported nor contradicted.
3. The highlighted words in the statement ("outside," "gun," "man") align with the content, but the additional detail ("with his friends") does not affect the neutrality since it neither contradicts nor is confirmed by the content.
4. The statement adds a social context ("with his friends") that is absent in the content, but this addition does not create a contradiction, only an unsupported extension.
5. Neutrality is maintained because the core facts (a man shooting a gun outdoors) are consistent, while the extra detail in the statement is irrelevant to the truth value of the content.
