2. The content does not specify the **gender ("boy")** of the skateboarding youth, so the statement cannot be confirmed or denied.

4. The statement assumes a **social context (showing tricks to friends)** that is not implied in the content, leading to neutrality.
5. The **highlighted words introduce subjectivity ("showing")** that is not verifiable from the factual description in the content.
6. The content describes a general action (doing a trick), while the statement adds **specific intent (showing off)**, which is neither confirmed nor contradicted.
7. The **"new"** in the statement implies recency, which is not mentioned in the content, contributing to neutrality.
8. The statement **narrows "youth" to "boy"**, a more specific term that may or may not align with the content.
9. The **highlighted words introduce agency ("showing")** where the content only describes an action, creating a gap in inference.
