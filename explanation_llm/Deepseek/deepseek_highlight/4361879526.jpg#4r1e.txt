1. "Men" is a subset of "people," so if two men are climbing, it necessarily means two people are climbing.
2. The term "people" is more general and includes "men," making the statement a broader but valid inference.
3. The highlighted words "two men" and "two people" are semantically compatible because all men are people.
4. The rest of the sentence ("climbing on a wooden scaffold") remains unchanged, so the action and context support the entailment.
5. The quantity ("two") is preserved, and the shift from "men" to "people" does not introduce contradiction.
6. No additional constraints in the statement exclude the possibility of the two individuals being men.
7. The statement does not specify gender beyond "people," so the content's specificity about "men" does not violate the entailment.
8. The core meaning (two individuals performing an action on a scaffold) is retained, ensuring logical consistency.
