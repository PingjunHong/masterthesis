1. The content does not specify what the man is pointing at, so the statement introduces new information ("purse snatcher") that cannot be confirmed or denied.
2. The word "man" in the statement is not explicitly mentioned in the content (only "he" is used), but it is a reasonable inference, making the relationship neutral.
3. The content describes a general scene without any indication of criminal activity ("purse snatcher"), so the statement introduces an unsupported claim.
4. The action of pointing is mentioned in both, but the target of the pointing ("something" vs. "purse snatcher") is too vague in the content to validate the statement.
5. The statement assumes a specific scenario (a crime) that is not implied or contradicted by the content, leaving the relationship neutral.
6. The highlighted words in the statement ("man," "purse snatcher") are either not present or not inferable from the content, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
