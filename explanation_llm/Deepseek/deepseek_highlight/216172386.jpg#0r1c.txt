1. The content describes a man standing on a motorbike, while the statement describes a man sitting in a car—these are two different actions (standing vs. sitting) and two different vehicles (motorbike vs. car).
2. The highlighted words in the content ("stands on his motorbike") directly contradict the highlighted words in the statement ("sitting in a car")—one cannot simultaneously stand on a motorbike and sit in a car.
3. The scenarios are mutually exclusive: a man cannot be on a motorbike and in a car at the same time in the described manner.
4. The posture and location of the man differ entirely between the two descriptions (standing on a motorbike vs. seated inside a car).
5. The actions and objects involved ("stands on motorbike" vs. "sitting in car") are incompatible, making the statement a contradiction of the content.
