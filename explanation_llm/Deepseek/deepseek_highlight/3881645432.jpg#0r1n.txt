1. The content does not mention the color of the employee's shirt, so the statement introduces new information not confirmed or contradicted by the content.
2. The presence of an employee is acknowledged in the content, but no details about their attire (including shirt color) are provided, making the statement neither supported nor refuted.
3. The highlighted words ("blue shirt") are unrelated to any specific details in the content, leaving the statement's truth value indeterminate.
4. The content focuses on the setting (aisle, computer, Geek Squad sign) rather than the employee's appearance, so the statement is neutral due to lack of relevant context.
5. The statement could be true or false based on real-world observations, but the content itself offers no evidence either way, resulting in neutrality.
