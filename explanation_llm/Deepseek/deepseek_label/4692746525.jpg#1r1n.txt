1. The old man's military cap does not necessarily confirm he is a veteran.
2. The old man's frown does not definitively indicate anger; it could reflect other emotions.
3. The crowd's signs and balloons do not explicitly state they are protesting a war.
4. The statement assumes the old man is watching the crowd, but his exact focus is unclear.
5. The old man's civilian suit suggests he may not be actively serving, weakening the "military" claim.
6. The crowd's purpose (protest or celebration) is ambiguous based on the description.
7. The term "veteran" implies past service, but the content does not confirm this.
8. The old man's presence in the crowd does not necessarily mean he is observing them as a distinct group.
9. The description lacks explicit evidence linking the old man's expression to the crowd's actions.
10. The statement infers intent (watching the protest) that is not explicitly supported by the content.
