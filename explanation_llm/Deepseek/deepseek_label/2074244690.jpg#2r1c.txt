1. The content states the group is gathered and watching an event, which contradicts being asleep.
2. Watching an event requires being awake, making it impossible for the group to be asleep simultaneously.
3. The group's activity (watching an event) is mutually exclusive with the state of being asleep.
4. The time (night) does not override the explicit activity described, so the contradiction remains.
5. If the group were asleep, they could not be actively gathered or watching anything.
6. Sleep implies inactivity, while watching an event implies engagement, creating a direct contradiction.
7. The statement negates the action described in the content (gathered/watching vs. asleep).
8. Physical presence at an event is incompatible with being unconscious or asleep.
9. The content describes observable behavior (watching), which cannot occur if the subjects are asleep.
10. The statement and content describe opposing states of consciousness (awake vs. asleep).
