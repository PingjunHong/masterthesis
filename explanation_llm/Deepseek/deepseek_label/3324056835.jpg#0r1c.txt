- "Some dogs" implies multiple dogs, not just one.
- "Running" suggests more than one dog is present.
- "Deserted beach" does not restrict the number of dogs to one.
- The statement contradicts the plurality indicated by "some dogs."
- The content does not support the claim of a single dog.
- "Only one dog" directly conflicts with "some dogs."
- The presence of multiple dogs invalidates the statement.
- The statement incorrectly narrows the count from "some" to "one."
- The content explicitly describes multiple dogs, not a singular one.
- The contradiction arises from the mismatch in quantity descriptions.
