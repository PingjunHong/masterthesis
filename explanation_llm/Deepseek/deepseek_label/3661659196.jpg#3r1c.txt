1. The content specifies the location as "next to lockers," not "next to the toilet."
2. "Lockers" and "toilet" are distinct locations, making the statement contradictory.
3. The statement misplaces the setting of the conversation.
4. The original context does not mention a toilet at all.
5. The girls' conversation is tied to lockers, not a restroom area.
6. The statement inaccurately describes the scene by changing the location.
7. "Next to the toilet" introduces a detail absent in the content.
8. The two locations (lockers vs. toilet) cannot both be correct simultaneously.
9. The contentâ€™s setting is unambiguous, making the statement false.
10. The contradiction arises from an incorrect spatial reference.
