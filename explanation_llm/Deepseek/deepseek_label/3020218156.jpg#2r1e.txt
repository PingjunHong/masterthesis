2. The term "guy" in the statement corresponds to "a man" in the content, both referring to the same individual.
3. The phrase "near a building" in the statement matches "in front of a building" in the content, as both imply proximity.
4. The statement's "stands by two other men" is consistent with the content's "two men to the side," indicating their spatial relationship.
5. The content's description of the man "on the phone" does not contradict the statement, as the statement does not mention phone usage but focuses on positioning.
6. The statement simplifies the content by omitting details like "pain on the side," but this does not invalidate the core spatial entailment.
7. The word "stands" in the statement is supported by "standing" in the content, confirming the posture.
8. The statement generalizes "two men to the side" as "two other men," which is logically equivalent in this context.
