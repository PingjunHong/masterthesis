1. The content states the boys are about to be hit, implying the wave is on course to strike them, while the statement claims the wave missed them.
2. The approaching wave's trajectory in the content contradicts the statement's assertion of a miss.
3. The content describes an imminent collision, whereas the statement describes an avoidance.
4. The boys' position relative to the wave in the content suggests contact is unavoidable, conflicting with the statement.
5. The content implies the wave will reach the boys, while the statement denies this outcome.
6. The statement negates the event described in the content, creating a direct contradiction.
7. The content's prediction of the wave hitting the boys is invalidated by the statement's claim of a miss.
8. The physical scenario in the content (wave approaching to hit) is incompatible with the statement's scenario (wave missing).
9. The statement reverses the expected outcome from the content, producing a contradiction.
10. The content and statement describe mutually exclusive events (hit vs. miss).
