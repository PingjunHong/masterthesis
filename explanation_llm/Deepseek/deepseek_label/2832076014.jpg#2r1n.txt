1. Driving a Land Rover across a river typically involves moving through water, which naturally causes splashing.
2. The action of driving through a river implies contact with water, leading to splashing as the vehicle displaces it.
3. The wheels and undercarriage of the Land Rover would disturb the water's surface, creating visible splashes.
4. The statement describes a direct consequence of the action mentioned in the content (driving across a river).
5. The verb "driven" in the content suggests motion through water, which inherently produces splashing effects.
6. The Land Rover's movement through the river would generate waves and spray, consistent with splashing.
7. The content implies interaction with water, and splashing is a predictable outcome of such interaction.
8. The statement provides a more detailed observation (splashing) of the scenario described in the content (driving across a river).
9. Physical laws dictate that a vehicle moving through water will displace it, resulting in splashing.
10. The statement is a specific instantiation of the general action described in the content.
