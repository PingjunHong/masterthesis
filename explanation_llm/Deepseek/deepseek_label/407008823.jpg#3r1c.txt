1. The action described in the content is "jump," while the statement says "slide," which are different actions.
2. The content mentions a "rope" as the means of crossing, whereas the statement refers to a "slide."
3. Jumping over a crevasse implies a dynamic, active movement, while sliding suggests a passive, smooth motion.
4. A rope requires gripping or balancing, while a slide typically involves sitting or lying down.
5. The two methods (rope vs. slide) involve entirely different equipment and mechanics.
6. The statement introduces an object (slide) not mentioned or implied in the content.
7. The content does not describe any structure like a slide being present.
8. Sliding over a crevasse would typically require a fixed, rigid structure, while a rope is flexible.
9. The physical feasibility of sliding over a crevasse on a slide is inconsistent with the scenario of using a rope.
10. The statement contradicts the content by replacing the primary method of crossing with an incompatible alternative.
