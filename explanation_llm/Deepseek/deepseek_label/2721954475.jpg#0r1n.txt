1. The statement does not specify what the people are doing near the square, so "wait" is a possible but unconfirmed action.
2. The content describes the people's location but not their activity, leaving their intent (e.g., waiting, observing, gathering) ambiguous.
3. "Wait" is a general term that could align with standing near the square, but the content does not provide explicit evidence for it.
4. The yellow writing on the square might imply a purpose (e.g., instructions, signage), but the content does not confirm whether the people are actively waiting for something.
5. The statement could be true, but the content does not provide enough information to verify or contradict it.
6. The people could be engaged in other activities (e.g., discussing, photographing) unrelated to waiting, making the statement neither supported nor refuted.
7. The large black square might be a focal point, but the content does not indicate whether the people are waiting for an event or simply gathered.
8. The statement is too vagueâ€”it does not specify what they are waiting for or how long, leaving room for interpretation.
9. The content describes a static scene, while "wait" implies duration, which cannot be inferred from the given information.
10. The people's presence near the square does not inherently mean they are waiting; they could be there for other reasons.
