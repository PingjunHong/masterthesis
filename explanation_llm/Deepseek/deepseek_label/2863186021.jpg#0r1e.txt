6. The direction of the woman's movement (towards the birds) implies they are within observable range.
7. The statement is general, and the content provides a specific instance that fits the description.
8. The presence of a flock inherently means birds are near the woman, even if not directly adjacent.
9. The content does not contradict the statement, and all elements (woman, birds) are present.
