1. The statement does not specify the type of workers (cleaners) or the exact event (St Patrick's Day parade/festival).
2. The content mentions a parade or festival, but the statement only generalizes it as "St Patrick's Day," which could include various events.
3. The statement does not confirm whether the animal feces are directly related to St Patrick's Day activities.
4. The content describes a general cleanup scenario, while the statement assumes a specific context (St Patrick's Day) without explicit evidence.
5. The statement could refer to any cleanup activity after St Patrick's Day, not necessarily the one described in the content.
6. The content does not provide enough detail to confirm the exact event or location, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
7. The workers in the statement could be performing a different cleanup task unrelated to the one in the content.
8. The statement lacks specificity about the nature of the cleanup (e.g., animal feces vs. general litter).
9. The content does not explicitly mention St Patrick's Day, leaving the statement unverifiable.
10. The statement is a plausible but unconfirmed inference from the content, as other festivals/parades could also involve cleanup.
