1. The boys are described as wearing athletic jerseys, which means they are not bare-chested.
2. Athletic jerseys cover the upper body, contradicting the claim of being bare-chested.
3. The statement directly conflicts with the content, which specifies the boys are clothed in jerseys.
4. "Bare-chested" implies no clothing on the upper body, but the content states the opposite.
5. The presence of jerseys negates the possibility of the boys being bare-chested.
6. The content explicitly mentions attire (athletic jerseys), making the statement false.
7. The boys cannot be both wearing jerseys and bare-chested simultaneously.
8. The statement ignores the described clothing, leading to a contradiction.
9. Athletic jerseys are upper-body garments, so the boys' chests are covered.
10. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the described attire and the claim of being bare-chested.
