2. The core action ("an older man leans") and location ("outside a building") are directly supported by the content.

4. The statement captures the main subject ("an older man") and primary action ("leans outside a building") without requiring the extra details.
5. The content’s description of the building as "ornate" and the man leaning "against a pedestal" are elaborations that do not negate the broader claim in the statement.
6. The statement is a valid abstraction of the content, focusing on the key elements while ignoring finer-grained information.
7. The content’s specifics (e.g., "pedestal") are subordinate to the broader scenario described in the statement.
8. The statement’s claim is a necessary consequence of the content’s more detailed description.
9. The content’s additional details do not alter the truth of the statement’s core proposition.
10. The statement and content share the same subject, action, and location, with the statement being less restrictive.
