1. The statement "A woman is working" is a general assertion that aligns with the specific detail "A woman working long hours," which implies she is indeed working.
2. "Working long hours" inherently includes the action of working, making the statement a direct subset of the content.
3. The content provides a more detailed scenario (long hours) that does not contradict the simpler claim in the statement (working).
4. The statement captures the core action (working) from the content, disregarding additional details (long hours), which do not negate it.
5. If a woman is working long hours, it logically follows that she is engaged in work, satisfying the statement.
6. The content’s specificity ("long hours") does not invalidate the broader, more general statement ("is working").
7. The statement is entailed because the content’s scenario (working long hours) cannot occur without the woman first being in a state of working.
8. The absence of conflicting information in the content ensures the statement’s truth is preserved.
9. The statement is a necessary condition for the content to hold—without the woman working, the scenario of long hours would not apply.
10. The content’s additional detail ("long hours") is irrelevant to the truth value of the statement, which only requires the action of working.
