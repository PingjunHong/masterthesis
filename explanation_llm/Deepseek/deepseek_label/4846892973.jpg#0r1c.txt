1. The content specifies people are standing on a pier, not in a boat.
2. A pier is a fixed structure on land or over water, distinct from a boat.
3. The presence of a table and glasses on the pier contradicts the idea of being in a boat.
4. Boats typically lack the space or stability for tables and glasses as described.
5. The foreground objects (table, glasses) suggest a stationary setting, unlike a moving boat.
6. The statement mislocates the scene by placing it in a boat instead of on the pier.
7. Standing on a pier implies solid ground, while being in a boat implies being on water.
8. The description of the setting does not mention any boat-related features (e.g., hull, oars).
9. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the stated location (boat) and the actual location (pier).
10. Boats and piers are mutually exclusive locations in this context.
