1. The content mentions a group of seven individuals, not specifying any gender, so referring to "the man" is unsupported.
2. The content describes the group rafting down the river without any mention of someone falling out.
3. The statement assumes a singular individual ("the man"), while the content refers to a group.
4. There is no indication in the content of any accident or mishap occurring during the rafting.
5. The content implies all individuals are still in the boat, as they are described as "rafting down the river."
6. The term "white water raft" suggests active participation, which contradicts the idea of someone having fallen out.
7. The statement introduces new information ("fallen out") not present or implied in the content.
8. The content's focus is on the activity itself, not on any disruptions or incidents.
9. The group is wearing rafting gear, which implies preparedness and safety, making a fall unlikely without explicit mention.
10. The statement contradicts the cohesive action described in the content (rafting together).
