1. The content does not mention the boy's hair length, making the "long-haired" detail unverifiable.
2. The content does not specify the speed of the skateboard, so "at a fast pace" cannot be confirmed.
3. The statement adds "riding his skateboard," implying ownership, which is not indicated in the content.
4. The content describes the boy as "on a skateboard," which is less specific than "riding" in the statement.
5. The statement's phrasing ("over a stone wall") could imply motion beyond what is described in the content ("on a stone wall").
6. The content does not contradict the statement but lacks sufficient detail to fully support it.
7. The statement introduces minor interpretive details (e.g., pace, hair length) that are neither confirmed nor denied by the content.
8. Neutrality arises because the statement extrapolates beyond the content without introducing outright contradictions.
