1. The content describes the woman holding a comb, while the statement claims her hands are empty.
2. The act of weaving requires tools, implying her hands are not empty, contrary to the statement.
3. The comb in her hand directly contradicts the assertion that her hands are empty.
4. Weaving involves manual activity, making it impossible for her hands to be empty as stated.
5. The statement ignores the presence of the comb mentioned in the content.
6. The content specifies an action (weaving) that necessitates holding something, conflicting with the statement.
7. The woman cannot simultaneously hold a comb and have empty hands.
8. The statement falsely negates the tool (comb) explicitly mentioned in the content.
9. The content provides evidence of an object in her hand, disproving the statement.
10. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the described activity (weaving with a comb) and the passive state (sitting with empty hands).
