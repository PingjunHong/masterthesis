1. The bathroom is part of the house, so the presence of adults and a child in the bathroom implies people are in the house.
2. "A group of adults" and "a small child" are people, and they are inside the bathroom, which is a room in the house.
3. The scene described (bathroom with people) inherently occurs within a residential setting, confirming the presence of people in the house.
4. The statement "People are in the house" is a general claim that is satisfied by the specific instance of people being in the bathroom.
5. The bathroom is an indoor location, and the presence of multiple people there supports the broader claim about the house.
6. The child being in the bath and adults being present indicates human activity inside a domestic space (the house).
7. The content describes a typical household scenario, which aligns with the statement about people being in a house.
8. The spatial context (bathroom) is a subset of the house, so the people observed there are necessarily in the house.
9. The statement is a logical abstraction of the content, as the house is the superset containing the bathroom and its occupants.
10. The presence of any people in any room of the house (here, the bathroom) validates the statement.
