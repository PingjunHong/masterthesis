1. The "rafting gear" implies the use of an inflatable boat, as such gear is typically associated with rafting in inflatable vessels.
2. White water rafting is commonly done in inflatable boats, making it likely that the group is in one.
3. The term "raft" in "white water raft" suggests the use of an inflatable boat, as rafts are often inflatable.
4. The presence of multiple individuals (seven) indicates a shared vessel, which in rafting is typically an inflatable boat.
5. The activity described (rafting down a river) is strongly associated with inflatable boats, supporting the entailment.
6. The statement does not specify the type of boat, but the context of rafting makes "inflatable boat" a reasonable inference.
7. The description of the activity aligns with common practices where people use inflatable boats for white water rafting.
8. The absence of any mention of alternative vessels (e.g., kayaks or canoes) strengthens the likelihood of an inflatable boat being used.
9. The group size (seven) is more consistent with an inflatable raft than smaller, non-inflatable watercraft.
10. The term "rafting gear" includes equipment typically used with inflatable boats, such as paddles and life jackets, further supporting the entailment.
