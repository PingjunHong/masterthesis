1. The content mentions "a group of cleaners" which matches the statement.
2. The content describes the cleaners "sweeping up animal feces from the street during a parade or festival," implying their activity occurs in the context of a parade.
3. The phrase "during a parade or festival" includes the possibility of the event being a parade, aligning with the statement's "after a parade."
4. The temporal context of cleaning (after the parade) is implied by the ongoing cleanup activity, as parades typically conclude before cleanup begins.
5. The statement is a simplified summary of the content, retaining the key elements (cleaners and parade) without additional details.
6. The content does not contradict the statement, as all elements in the statement are supported by the content.
7. The statement generalizes "during a parade or festival" to "after a parade," which is a plausible inference since cleanup usually follows the event.
8. The activity of sweeping up animal feces suggests post-event cleanup, reinforcing the "after a parade" interpretation.
