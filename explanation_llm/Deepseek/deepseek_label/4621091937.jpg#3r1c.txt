1. The content states there are men sitting on the side of the road, which means it is not empty.
2. The presence of men contradicts the claim that the side of the road is empty.
3. "Empty" implies no people or objects are present, but the content confirms the presence of men.
4. The statement falsely asserts the absence of people where the content confirms their existence.
5. The side of the road cannot be both occupied by men and empty at the same time.
6. The description of men sitting there directly negates the possibility of the side being empty.
7. The statement ignores the observable fact (men present) that makes the side non-empty.
8. If the side were empty, there would be no men sitting there, but the content proves otherwise.
9. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the observed scenario (men present) and the claim (empty).
10. The statement is factually incorrect because the content provides evidence of occupancy.
