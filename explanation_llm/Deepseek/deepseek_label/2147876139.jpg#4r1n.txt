1. "Three girls" implies "some people" because three is a subset of the general category "people."
2. "Blow out the candles" directly matches "blowing out candles," confirming the action described.
3. The statement generalizes the specific group ("three girls") to a broader group ("some people"), which is logically valid.
4. The action of blowing out candles is performed by the girls, so the statement accurately reflects the content.
5. The presence of any group performing the action satisfies the existential quantifier "some" in the statement.
6. The statement does not require all people to be blowing out candles, only some, which aligns with the content.
7. The specificity of the cake being made of Peeps is irrelevant to the entailment of the statement, which focuses only on the action and actors.
8. The number of people (three) is sufficient to qualify as "some," as it is more than one and thus a non-singular group.
9. The statement’s generality is broader than the content’s specificity, allowing for entailment.
10. The action and actors in the content fully satisfy the conditions required by the statement.
