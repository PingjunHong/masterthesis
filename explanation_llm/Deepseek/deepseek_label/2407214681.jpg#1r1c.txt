1. The content specifies the boys are in blue soccer uniforms, not band uniforms.
2. The description of the uniforms as "soccer" directly contradicts the statement's claim of "band."
3. There is no mention of musical instruments or band-related items in the content.
4. The color and type of uniform (soccer) are explicitly stated, leaving no ambiguity for band uniforms.
5. The context (washing hands in a bathroom) does not support a band-related activity.
6. The uniforms are described as sportswear, which is inconsistent with the formal or performance attire of band uniforms.
7. The content focuses on a sports setting (soccer), not a musical or performance setting.
8. No evidence in the content suggests the boys are involved in a band or musical activity.
9. The statement introduces an unrelated category (band) that does not align with the provided details.
10. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the described activity (soccer) and the claimed activity (band).
