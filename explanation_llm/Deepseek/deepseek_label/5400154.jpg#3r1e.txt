1. "Two men" implies at least two individuals, which satisfies "some people" (typically meaning at least one).
2. "Standing in a boat" directly indicates presence "in a boat," matching the statement.
3. The term "men" is a subset of "people," so the content's subjects are included in the statement's broader category.
4. The count "two" meets the minimum requirement for "some," which does not specify a lower bound.
5. The action ("standing") confirms the men are actively present in the boat, aligning with "are in."
6. No contradictory information exists in the content to negate the statement.
7. The statement generalizes the content (from specific individuals to "people") without introducing falsehoods.
8. Logical consistency holds: if two men are in a boat, it is true that some people are in it.
