1. The original content does not mention the father's location or activity, so the statement introduces new information (father being at work) that cannot be confirmed or contradicted.
2. The statement adds a temporal condition ("while he is at work") that is not implied or supported by the original content, making it neither entailed nor contradicted.
3. The original content only describes the child playing with the boots, leaving the father's presence or absence unspecified, so the statement's additional detail is unrelated to the given information.
4. The statement assumes a causal or situational link (father being at work) that is not present in the original content, making it an independent extension rather than an inference.
5. The original content is neutral about the father's involvement or context, so the statement neither follows logically nor conflicts with it.
6. The added detail in the statement ("while he is at work") does not alter the core action (child playing with boots) and does not introduce any contradiction.
7. The statement introduces an unverifiable scenario (father at work) that is neither supported nor contradicted by the original content, maintaining neutrality.
8. The original content lacks sufficient information to determine the father's whereabouts, so the statement's extension is neither entailed nor negated.
9. The statement's additional context does not interact logically with the original content, leaving the relationship neutral.
10. The core meaning of the original content (child playing with boots) remains unchanged by the statement's added detail, preserving neutrality.
