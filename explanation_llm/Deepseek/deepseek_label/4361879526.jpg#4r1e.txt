2. The statement generalizes the specific term "men" to the broader category "people," which remains accurate.
3. The scaffold material (wooden) and the action (climbing) are unchanged, preserving the core meaning.
4. The quantity (two) is identical in both the content and the statement.
5. No contradictory or additional information is introduced in the statement that would invalidate the entailment.
6. The statement retains all key elements of the content while allowing for minor lexical variation ("men" â†’ "people").
7. The semantic relationship between the entities and their action is preserved.
8. The statement does not narrow or expand the scope in a way that conflicts with the content.
9. Both the content and the statement describe the same event with equivalent specificity.
10. The change from "men" to "people" does not alter the truth conditions of the original content.
