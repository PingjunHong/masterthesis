1. The content explicitly states that "the boys are playing with Legos," which directly confirms the statement "Boys are playing."
2. "Playing with Legos" is a specific instance of "playing," so the general activity in the statement is entailed by the more detailed activity in the content.
3. The subject "the boys" in the content aligns with "Boys" in the statement, ensuring the same group is referenced.
4. The verb "are playing" in the statement is a subset of the action described in the content ("are playing with Legos"), making the entailment logically valid.
5. No contradictory information exists between the content and the statement; the content only provides additional details without negating the core claim.
6. The temporal aspect ("are") in both the content and the statement indicates the same ongoing action, reinforcing the entailment.
7. The statement abstracts away the specific toy (Legos) mentioned in the content, but the core activity ("playing") remains unchanged.
8. The contentâ€™s specificity does not introduce any conditions or exceptions that would invalidate the broader claim in the statement.
9. The semantic overlap between "playing with Legos" and "playing" is sufficient to satisfy the definition of entailment.
10. The statement is a simplification of the content, retaining only the essential elements (subject and action) needed for entailment.
