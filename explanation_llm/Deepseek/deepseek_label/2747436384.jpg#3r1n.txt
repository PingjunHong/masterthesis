1. The statement generalizes "boys" to "a group of people," which is broader but not contradictory.
2. "Play in the ocean" is a plausible interpretation of "boys with their backs against an incoming wave," as the wave suggests recreational activity.
3. The content does not confirm or deny that the boys are playing; it only describes their posture relative to the wave.
4. The statement does not introduce information conflicting with the content (e.g., location, action, or participants).
5. "A group of people" could include boys, making the statement consistent with the content.
6. The content lacks details about intent (play vs. other activities), leaving room for neutral interpretation.
7. The statement does not make claims about specifics (e.g., wave size, exact actions) that could contradict the content.
8. Both the content and statement describe a scene near the ocean without disagreement.
9. The term "play" is vague enough to encompass standing against a wave as part of recreational behavior.
10. No explicit contradiction exists between the physical description in the content and the inferred activity in the statement.
