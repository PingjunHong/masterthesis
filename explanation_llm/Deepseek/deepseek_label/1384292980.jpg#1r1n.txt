1. The content does not mention the destination of the girls, so the statement introduces new, unverifiable information.
2. The action "walk down the street" does not imply or contradict the intention of "going to the park."
3. The statement assumes a purpose ("going to the park") not stated or supported by the content.
4. The content describes an action (walking) without specifying direction or goal, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
5. The park could be located down the street, but the content does not confirm or deny this possibility.
6. The statement introduces a potential but unconfirmed extension of the scenario described in the content.
7. The content is too general to support or refute the specific claim about the girls' destination.
8. The statement could be true or false independently of the content, as they describe different levels of detail.
9. The content lacks contextual details (e.g., landmarks, time) that would link the girls' walk to the park.
10. The statement's claim is plausible but not inferable from the given content alone.
