1. The content states that the people are "standing outside of a place," which directly implies they are not inside the building.
2. The phrase "in front of a building" further confirms their location is exterior, not interior.
3. The description focuses on their activity ("talking to each other") occurring outside, with no mention of movement or presence inside.
4. The sign 'HI-POINTE' is visible from the outside, suggesting the observer's perspective is external, aligning with the people being outside.
5. No contradictory information in the content suggests the people are inside the building.
6. The word "outside" explicitly negates the possibility of them being inside.
7. The absence of any indicators (e.g., entering, exiting, or being described within the building) supports the entailment.
8. The statement's negation ("aren't inside") is consistent with the content's spatial description.
