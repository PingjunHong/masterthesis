1. The content states the men are homeless, directly contradicting the statement that they own homes.
2. The description of the men as "homeless" explicitly negates the possibility of them owning homes.
3. The context (sitting against a wall with a sleeping dog) implies transient living conditions, inconsistent with home ownership.
4. Homeowners are unlikely to be described as "homeless," making the statement factually incorrect.
5. The presence of a dog on a leash in a public space further suggests lack of private property ownership.
6. The label "homeless" is categorical and incompatible with the assertion of home ownership.
7. No evidence in the content supports home ownership; all details point to homelessness.
8. The statement ignores the explicit information provided in the content.
9. "Own homes" requires possession of property, which contradicts the men's homeless status.
10. The scenario described (sitting against a wall) is atypical for homeowners, reinforcing the contradiction.
