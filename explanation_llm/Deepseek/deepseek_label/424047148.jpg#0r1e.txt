2. "Face partially covered in silver face paint" directly indicates the presence of an external substance on her face.
3. The statement "has something on her face" is a general description that includes face paint as a valid instance.
4. The presence of face paint satisfies the condition of "something" being on her face, regardless of the specific material.
5. The description of the woman's appearance confirms the statement without requiring additional context.
6. The term "something" is broad enough to encompass face paint, making the entailment valid.
7. No part of the content contradicts the statement, supporting the entailment.
8. The statement does not specify the type or amount of substance, so the face paint qualifies.
9. The woman's action of "looking in a mirror" implies awareness of her appearance, consistent with having face paint on.
