1. The location specified in the content (library steps) differs from the location in the statement (school steps).
2. Libraries and schools are distinct places, making the steps of one incompatible with the steps of the other.
3. The child cannot simultaneously be on the library steps and the school steps if these are separate locations.
4. The statement misidentifies the building (school instead of library).
5. The content explicitly places the child at the library, contradicting the claim of being at the school.
6. "Library steps" and "school steps" refer to different physical structures, creating a direct contradiction.
7. The child's presence on the library steps negates the possibility of being on the school steps at the same time.
8. The statement inaccurately relocates the child from the library to the school.
9. The content and statement describe mutually exclusive locations for the child.
10. The assertion that the child is on the school steps is false based on the content's confirmation of the library steps.
