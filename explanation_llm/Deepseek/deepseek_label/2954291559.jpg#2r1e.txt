1. The worker mentioned in the content is a person, satisfying the subject of the statement.
2. "Atop a building under construction" in the content directly matches "atop of a building" in the statement, as the latter is a general case of the former.
3. "Peers out" implies the worker is positioned on the building, confirming the location specified in the statement.
4. The statement does not require the building to be under construction, so the broader condition ("atop a building") is entailed by the more specific content.
5. The action of "peering out" does not contradict the statement's claim about the person's location, reinforcing the entailment.
6. The absence of any negation or conflicting information in the content ensures the statement's validity.
7. The term "worker" is a subset of "person," ensuring the subject alignment is logically sound.
8. The spatial descriptor "atop" is used identically in both content and statement, preserving the directional relationship.
9. No additional constraints (e.g., time, identity) in the statement prevent the entailment from holding.
10. The content provides sufficient evidence (worker + location) to infer the statement without ambiguity.
