1. The content specifies that all people in the group are wearing black shirts, which contradicts the statement that the driver was wearing a purple shirt.
2. The open-top vehicle allows clear visibility of the occupants, making it unlikely to misidentify the driver's shirt color as purple when it is actually black.
3. If the driver were part of the group, their shirt color would have to be black, not purple.
4. The statement introduces a shirt color (purple) not mentioned or implied in the content, creating a direct contradiction.
5. The content implies uniformity in shirt color (black) among the group, leaving no room for the driver to wear a different color.
6. No exceptions or additional details about shirt colors are provided in the content, so the claim about the purple shirt is unsupported.
7. The contradiction arises from the mismatch between the observed (black) and claimed (purple) shirt colors of the driver.
