1. The content describes people seated at long tables, which directly matches the statement about a group of people sitting at tables.
2. The phrase "People seated at long tables" in the content confirms the presence of individuals sitting at tables, aligning with the statement.
3. The statement generalizes the specific scenario in the content (people at long tables) to a broader but accurate description (people at tables).
4. The content implies a collective setting ("People seated"), which satisfies the "group of people" in the statement.
5. The actions of the people (writing, watching) are irrelevant to the statement's focus on their seated position at tables, so the core claim holds.
6. The direction the people are facing (all the same) does not contradict the statement, leaving the entailment intact.
7. The statement does not specify the type or number of tables, so the "long tables" in the content do not conflict with it.
8. The absence of additional details in the statement (e.g., activities, table length) means the content's specifics do not violate the entailment.
9. The statement is a subset of the information in the content, as "sitting at tables" is a subset of "seated at long tables... writing and watching."
10. The content does not contain any information that contradicts the statement, ensuring the entailment holds.
