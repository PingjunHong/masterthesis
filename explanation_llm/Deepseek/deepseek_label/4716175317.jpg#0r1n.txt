1. The content does not specify what the street market sells, so the statement introduces new information (fruits) that is not confirmed or contradicted.
2. The presence of a crowd shopping does not inherently indicate what items are being sold, making the statement neither supported nor refuted.
3. The statement assumes the market sells fruits, but the content only describes a generic street market without details about products.
4. The background (buildings, statue) is irrelevant to whether the market sells fruits, leaving the statement unverifiable.
5. The statement could be true, but the content provides no evidence to confirm or deny it, resulting in neutrality.
6. The market might sell fruits among other items, but the content does not specify, making the statement neither entailed nor contradicted.
7. The crowd’s activity (shopping) is consistent with the statement, but the merchandise remains unspecified, leading to neutrality.
8. The statement narrows the market’s offerings to fruits, while the content describes a broader, undefined market.
9. Without explicit mention of fruits or other goods, the statement’s specificity is ungrounded in the content.
10. The content’s focus is on the scene (crowd, urban setting) rather than the market’s inventory, leaving the statement neutral.
