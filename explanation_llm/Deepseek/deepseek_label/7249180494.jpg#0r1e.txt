1. The professional swimmer is a person, so the statement "A person is swimming" is true.
2. The action of surfacing and spitting water implies the swimmer was previously submerged, which requires swimming.
3. Grabbing the hand of someone helping him back to land suggests the swimmer was in the water, engaging in swimming activity.
4. The term "professional swimmer" inherently indicates that the person was swimming.
5. The entire scenario describes an aquatic activity, which aligns with the definition of swimming.
6. Surfacing from water is an action that follows swimming underwater.
7. The context implies the swimmer was actively moving in the water before being helped out.
8. Spitting water out is a common behavior after swimming, further supporting the entailment.
9. The swimmer's need for assistance back to land suggests prior exertion in the water, consistent with swimming.
10. The statement generalizes the specific instance (a professional swimmer) to the broader category (a person swimming).
