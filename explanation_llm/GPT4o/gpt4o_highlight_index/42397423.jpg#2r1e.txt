1. Both sentences describe a "boy" involved in the action, establishing a consistent subject between the content and the statement.
2. The action "walks" in the content aligns with "walking" in the statement, indicating the same activity is taking place.
3. The setting described in the content, "on a pipe that stretches over water," implies an outdoor environment, which is consistent with "outside" in the statement.
4. "A young boy" in the content can be reasonably generalized as "a boy," as "young" specifies a subset of "boy" and does not contradict the statement.
5. The context of walking on a pipe over water inherently suggests an external or open-air location, which supports the statement that the activity is occurring outside.
