1. The content describes an action (looking at the camera) and the situation (holding pipes and a large object), but it does not provide information about the men's destination or purpose, so it does not confirm they are going to work.
2. The content does not specify whether the men are employed or in a work-related context, as it only describes their immediate actions and surroundings.
3. The presence of pipes and a large object could suggest a work-related activity, but the content does not explicitly state this, making it uncertain if the men are actually going to work.
4. The content's description of the men looking at the camera does not relate to the action of going to work, as it could be a separate, unrelated activity.
5. The statement "going to work" is an assumption about future intent or purpose that is not explicitly supported by the content, which only describes a static scene.
