- The content mentions "two people talking," but does not specify their occupations or activities, so they could be fishermen or any other types of people.
- The statement specifies "fishermen," which is more specific than the content, which only describes "people," leaving open the possibility that the people are engaged in different activities.
- The word "dock" is present in both the content and the statement, but the activity of fishing is not explicitly mentioned in the content.
- The content does not provide information about what the people are doing on the dock, so they could be there for reasons unrelated to fishing.
