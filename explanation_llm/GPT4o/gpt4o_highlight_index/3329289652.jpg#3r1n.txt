1. The location of the activity is unspecified in the content, so it does not confirm or contradict the statement that the boys are playing outside.
2. The content focuses on the activity (playing with Legos) rather than the location, while the statement mentions the location (outside) without specifying the activity.
3. The statement could be true if the boys are playing with Legos outside, but the content does not provide enough information to determine whether they are indoors or outdoors.
