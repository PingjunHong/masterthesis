- "Forest" and "highway" refer to different types of environments; a forest is a natural, wooded area, whereas a highway is a paved road designed for vehicular traffic.
- Riding through a forest typically implies navigating through trees and natural terrain, which is inconsistent with riding on a highway, a structured road for faster travel.
- A motorcycle being ridden in a forest suggests off-road or trail biking, contrasting with highway riding, which is typically on a smooth, designated lane for vehicles.
