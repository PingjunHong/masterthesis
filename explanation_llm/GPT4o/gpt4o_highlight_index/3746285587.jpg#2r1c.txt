1. The highlighted word "kneeling" in the content implies that the woman is on her knees, which contradicts the action of "riding" a bicycle, as riding a bicycle requires sitting or standing on the bicycle, not kneeling.
2. The action of kneeling in the street suggests a stationary position, whereas riding a bicycle implies movement, creating a contradiction between the two activities.
3. The location of "in the street" where the woman is kneeling does not align with the typical scenario of riding a bicycle, which involves being on the bicycle, not on the ground.
