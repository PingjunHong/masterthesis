1. Cutting wood can serve multiple purposes beyond building a table, so the activity described does not necessarily imply they are building a table.
2. The statement about building a table introduces a specific intention that is not evident in the content, making the relationship neutral.
3. The content only mentions sawing a log, which could be for any project, while the statement makes an assumption about a specific use.
4. The activity of sawing a log does not inherently indicate the final product or purpose, leaving the possibility of building a table as one of many options.
5. The content does not provide information about the intended outcome or project, making the statement about building a table speculative.
