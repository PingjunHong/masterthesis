1. The statement specifies "mom" and "son," while the content does not specify the relationship between the adults and the child.
2. The content mentions a "group of adults," which could include any combination of people, not necessarily the child's mother or her friends.
3. The content describes the adults "looking down a small child in the bath," but does not indicate the child's gender or relationship to the adults, making the statement's specification of "her son" unverifiable.
4. The content does not provide information on whether the adults are "friends" of the child's mother, so the involvement of "friends" is an assumption that cannot be confirmed.
