1. "Riding" in the content implies that the action of biking is currently happening, whereas "getting ready" in the statement suggests that the biking action has not yet started.
2. The content describes people actively participating in biking, while the statement indicates preparation or future intention to ride, not the current action.
3. The contradiction arises from the difference between the ongoing activity ("riding") and the preparatory state ("getting ready"), indicating different stages of the biking process.
