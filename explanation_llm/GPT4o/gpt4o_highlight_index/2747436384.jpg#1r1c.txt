1. The content indicates that the boys are about to be hit by the wave, implying an imminent impact, whereas the statement asserts that the wave missed them, indicating no impact occurred.
2. The word "hit" in the content suggests a direct encounter between the wave and the boys, while the statement claims the wave "missed," implying the boys were not affected by the wave.
3. "About to be hit" in the content suggests a certainty of impact, contrasting with the statement's "missed," which suggests the wave did not reach or affect the boys.
4. The content describes a scenario where the boys are in the path of the wave, while the statement implies they were not in the path, as the wave missed them.
5. The action of being "hit" denotes physical contact in the content, in contradiction to the statement where the absence of contact is described with "missed."
