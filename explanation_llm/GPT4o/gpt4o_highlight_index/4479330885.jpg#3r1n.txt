1. The term "younger people" in the content can refer to a broader age range than "young people" in the statement, which makes the age description neutral since both could be applicable.
2. Sitting "in front of a statue" and "in a school courtyard" are different locations, but neither location excludes the presence of the other, as a statue could be in a school courtyard, making the relationship neutral.
3. The word "several" is used in both the content and the statement, indicating an unspecified number of people, which maintains neutrality as the quantity is not contradicted.
4. The content does not explicitly mention a school setting, making the statement about a school courtyard a possibility rather than a contradiction, thus remaining neutral.
