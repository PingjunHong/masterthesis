- "Gets ready to kick" implies an action and being awake, while "sleeping" indicates a state of rest and unconsciousness.
- "Soccer ball" suggests a sporting activity taking place, whereas "at home" implies being indoors and not participating in outdoor sports.
- The action of getting ready to kick a ball cannot be performed simultaneously with the act of sleeping, as one requires physical engagement and the other a lack of awareness.
