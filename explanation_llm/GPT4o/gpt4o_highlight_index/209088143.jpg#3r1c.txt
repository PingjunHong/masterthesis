1. The statement mentions "by the side of a swimming pool," which is not explicitly stated or implied in the content, making it uncertain if the house party includes a poolside area.
2. The content describes people "getting drunk," but the statement simply mentions "partying," which is a broader activity and not limited to intoxication.
3. The content specifies a "house party," while the statement's focus on the "swimming pool" suggests a different setting or additional context not confirmed by the content.
4. The presence of a swimming pool is not confirmed in the content, so it's unclear if any part of the house party is occurring poolside as suggested by the statement.
5. The content does not specify the location or activities beyond "getting drunk," so the statement's reference to being "by the side of a swimming pool" adds speculative detail not directly supported by the content.
