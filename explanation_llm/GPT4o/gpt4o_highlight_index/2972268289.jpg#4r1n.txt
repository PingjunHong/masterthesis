1. The term "first time roper" in the statement doesn't specify whether the cowboy has called off his horse during calf roping, thus not directly contradicting or supporting the content.
2. Falling off a horse is an event that can occur independently of the cowboy's actions in calling off his horse, so the statement describes a separate scenario.
3. The statement focuses on the action of a roper falling, which is unrelated to the activity of calling off the horse as described in the content.
4. The statement introduces the element of inexperience ("first time roper"), which is not addressed in the content, leaving the relationship between the two actions unspecified.
5. The statement does not confirm or deny the specific timing or context in which the cowboy might call off his horse; thus, it maintains a neutral stance relative to the content.
