1. The term "friends" in the statement does not imply the same relationship as "homeless men" in the content, as being friends is a matter of personal relationship status, while homelessness is a socioeconomic condition. Therefore, it's unclear whether the men are friends.
2. The word "pet" in the statement is not specified in the content, which only mentions a "dog." There is no information indicating that the dog is a pet.
3. The use of "their" in the statement implies ownership or a relationship between the dog and the men, which is not explicitly mentioned in the content. The content does not provide enough information to confirm or negate this relationship.
