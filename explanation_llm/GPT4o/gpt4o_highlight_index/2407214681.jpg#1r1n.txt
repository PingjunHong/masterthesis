1. The statement about the boys winning their soccer game is not directly supported or contradicted by the content, as the content only describes the boys washing their hands and does not mention the outcome of a soccer game.
2. The content provides no information about the boys' performance in a soccer game, so it is unclear whether they won, lost, or did not participate in a game at all.
3. The boys being in soccer uniforms suggests involvement in soccer, but it does not provide any evidence regarding the result of a game, leaving the statement about winning as a possibility but not a certainty.
4. The action of washing hands is unrelated to the outcome of a soccer match, so it neither confirms nor denies that they won, making the statement neutral.
5. The content focuses on the setting and activity (washing hands) without any context related to a soccer game's results, meaning the statement about winning remains unverified by the content.
