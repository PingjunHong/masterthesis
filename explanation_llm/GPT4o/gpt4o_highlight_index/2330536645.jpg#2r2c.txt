- Playing in the water and playing mini golf are mutually exclusive activities, as they require different settings and equipment.
- The context of "in the water" suggests a location involving water, while "mini golf" takes place on a dry surface such as a mini golf course.
- Children playing in water implies they are engaging in water-related activities, whereas playing mini golf involves hitting balls into holes on a course, which is unrelated to water activities.
- The activity of playing in the water often involves elements like swimming or splashing, which do not align with the structured and dry nature of playing mini golf.
- The environment necessary for playing in the water (such as a pool, lake, or ocean) is distinctly different from a mini golf setting, which typically consists of artificial turf and obstacles.
