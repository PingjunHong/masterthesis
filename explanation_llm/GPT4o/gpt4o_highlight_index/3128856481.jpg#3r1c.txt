- A duck expanding its wings implies activity or motion, whereas sleeping suggests inactivity or rest.
- Expanding its wings indicates the duck is awake and possibly moving, while sleeping implies the duck is not engaged in any physical activity.
- The action of expanding wings is inconsistent with the state of being asleep, as sleeping ducks typically have their wings folded or at rest.
