1. The building painted white and blue with the words ING and PEOPLE written on it does not necessarily indicate that it is a school; it could be any type of building, such as an office or a community center.
2. The description of the building in the content is not specific enough to conclusively identify it as a school, leaving room for multiple interpretations.
3. There is no direct evidence in the content that links the building to being a school; the presence of words like ING and PEOPLE could relate to many other contexts.
4. The statement assumes the building's function without any supporting details from the content, making it an assumption rather than a contradiction or an entailment.
5. The words ING and PEOPLE are not typically associated exclusively with schools, so the statement about the school remains plausible but not definitive.
