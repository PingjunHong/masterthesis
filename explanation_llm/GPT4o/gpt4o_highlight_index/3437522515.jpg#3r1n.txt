1. "Tending to a garden" can involve various activities besides weeding, such as watering, planting, or pruning, so the specific activity of "weeding" is not necessarily implied.
2. The term "lady" is used in the statement, while "older woman" is used in the content; these terms are not synonymous and may suggest different age perceptions or social contexts.
3. The content does not specify the exact actions being performed in the garden, leaving room for multiple interpretations of what "tending" could involve.
4. The statement assumes a specific action ("weeding"), which may or may not be occurring, as the content only broadly describes garden work.
