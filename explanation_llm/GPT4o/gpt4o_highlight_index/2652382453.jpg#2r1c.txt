1. "Everyone on the street" implies that all individuals are engaged in their own activities, while "The people are watching" implies a collective action or focus, creating a contradiction.
2. "Seem to be busy doing their own thing" suggests individual and independent activities, whereas "are watching" implies a shared, unified activity, leading to a contradiction.
3. "In the city" indicates a broad range of activities typically expected in an urban environment, while "watching what is happening" suggests a single, specific event or focus, which contradicts the notion of varied individual activities.
4. "Busy" connotes being occupied with tasks, whereas "watching" suggests a passive, observational activity, which contradicts the active engagement implied in the content.
