1. "Escalator" and "elevator" refer to different modes of vertical transportation, with an escalator being a moving staircase and an elevator being a lift or cabin that moves vertically.
2. The action "waiting" associated with the escalator suggests a passive state, while "taking" the elevator implies an active choice or action, which can be seen as contradictory in terms of how people engage with these modes of transport.
3. The experience of "looking outside of the glass that makes up the wall" on an escalator implies visibility and openness, which contrasts with the typical enclosed and limited visibility environment within an elevator.
