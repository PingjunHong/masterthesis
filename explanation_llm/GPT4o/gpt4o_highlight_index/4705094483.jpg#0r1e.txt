1. The highlighted word "shirt" in the Statement is a more general term that is entailed by "black shirt" in the Content, as all black shirts are a subset of shirts.
2. The presence of the adjective "black" in "black shirt" specifies the color of the shirt, but does not change the fundamental fact that it is a shirt, maintaining the truth of the Statement.
3. The Statement makes a less specific claim about the shirt's color, which is consistent with the more specific claim in the Content, hence it is entailed.
4. The removal of the color adjective "black" in the Statement does not alter the truth conditions regarding the presence of a shirt, allowing the entailment to hold.
