1. A newlywed couple implies that the couple has recently gotten married, whereas a divorced couple implies that they have legally ended their marriage, which are mutually exclusive states.
2. "Newlywed" suggests a current marital status of being recently married, contradicting "divorced," which indicates that the marital status has ended.
3. The term "newlywed" denotes a state of being fresh into a marriage, while "divorced" signifies that the marriage has been dissolved, representing opposite conditions.
4. Being "newlywed" means the couple is in the phase immediately after marriage, whereas being "divorced" means they are no longer married, creating a direct contradiction.
