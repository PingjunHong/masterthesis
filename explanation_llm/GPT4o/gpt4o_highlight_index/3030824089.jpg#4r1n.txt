1. The statement introduces the specific detail "outside," which is not mentioned in the content, making it possible but not necessarily true based on the content alone.
2. The content "A dog runs" is a general statement and doesn't specify the location, leaving room for various possibilities, including running outside or elsewhere.
3. The addition of "outside" in the statement adds information that is consistent with the content but not directly supported by it, maintaining a neutral relationship.
4. The content provides no information regarding the setting or environment of the dog's action, so the statement's claim about being outside is neither confirmed nor denied.
5. The content and statement both describe a dog running, but the location detail in the statement is extra information not addressed in the content.
