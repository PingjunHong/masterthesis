1. A dog jumping over an obstacle implies it is on dry land, while being in a pool suggests the dog is in water, which contradicts the dry land setting.
2. Jumping over an obstacle requires a solid surface for launching and landing, whereas being in a pool indicates the dog is surrounded by water, preventing such action.
3. The physical activity of jumping over something typically occurs outside of a pool, as pools are not conducive environments for such actions.
4. A dog in a pool is typically swimming or floating, which is incompatible with the action of jumping over an obstacle.
