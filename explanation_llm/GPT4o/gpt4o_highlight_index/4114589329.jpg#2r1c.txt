- "Boys" in the content contradicts "girls" in the statement, as they refer to different genders.
- The presence of "boys" indicates a male group, while "girls" indicates a female group, leading to a gender-based contradiction.
- The content specifies "boys" while the statement specifies "girls," which are not interchangeable terms.
- The statement's reference to "girls" directly conflicts with the content's reference to "boys," making it a contradiction.
