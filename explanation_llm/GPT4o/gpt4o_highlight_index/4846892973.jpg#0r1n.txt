1. The presence of people on a pier does not necessarily indicate they are going fishing; there are many activities one can do on a pier.
2. The statement that "They are going fishing" cannot be confirmed by the description, as the content does not mention fishing equipment or activities related to fishing.
3. The number of people and the setting described (a pier with a table and glasses) do not inherently imply a fishing trip is planned or taking place.
4. The content lacks specific details that directly connect the people on the pier to the activity of fishing, making the statement an assumption rather than a direct inference.
5. The statement about people going fishing is a possibility but not a certainty based on the given scene, as piers can be used for multiple purposes besides fishing.
