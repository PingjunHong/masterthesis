- "Boy" and "male" both refer to a young male human, which indicates that the subject in both sentences is the same gender.
- The term "clothes" encompasses items like "sweatshirt," so the boy wearing an orange sweatshirt with red sleeves fits the description of having clothes on.
- The action of "using scissors to cut something" implies that the boy has "a pair of scissors in his hands," as one cannot use scissors without holding them.
