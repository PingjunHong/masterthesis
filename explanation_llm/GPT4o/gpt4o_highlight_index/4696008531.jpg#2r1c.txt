1. The action of "trying to throw something" requires the man to be engaged in a throwing motion, which contradicts the action of "walking away," as both actions cannot occur simultaneously.
2. "Trying to throw something" implies a stationary or focused position to execute the throw, while "walking away" suggests movement in a different direction, making it impossible to do both at the same time.
3. "Throwing" involves an active engagement with an object, whereas "walking away" indicates the man is leaving the scene, making it unlikely he is interacting with any objects as described.
