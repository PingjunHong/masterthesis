1. The statement specifies the location as a factory, which is not mentioned in the content, leaving the possibility that the woman could be working long hours elsewhere.
2. The content describes the duration of work ("long hours") but does not specify the type of work or location, while the statement specifies the location but not the duration.
3. The content and statement could both be true simultaneously without contradiction, as the content does not exclude factory work, nor does the statement exclude other types of work or durations.
4. The statement introduces additional details about the working environment that are neither confirmed nor denied by the content, resulting in neutrality.
