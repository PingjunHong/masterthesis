- Men who are illiterate would not have the capability to instruct their dog to write a sign, as writing requires literacy skills.
- The act of convincing a dog to write a sign implies a level of intelligence and communication that contradicts the description of the men as illiterate.
- Dogs generally do not have the ability to write, making the statement about convincing a dog to write the sign illogical.
- The statement assumes the men had the ability to communicate complex tasks to their dog, which contradicts the claim of their illiteracy.
