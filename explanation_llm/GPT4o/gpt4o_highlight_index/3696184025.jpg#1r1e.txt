1. "A young girl" entails "A girl" because a young girl is a specific type of girl, so the presence of "young" provides additional detail but does not contradict the general statement of "a girl."
2. "Standing on a blanket" entails "standing" because standing on a blanket inherently involves standing, and the location detail "on a blanket" does not negate the act of standing.
3. The content mentions "a yellow top and a flowered skirt," which offers extra description about the girl, but it does not alter the fact that she is "standing," which is the primary focus of the statement.
