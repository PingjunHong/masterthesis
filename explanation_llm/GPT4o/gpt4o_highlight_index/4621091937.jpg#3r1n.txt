1. The content mentions "men sitting" but does not specify any action related to "talking," so it's unclear if the men are indeed talking.
2. The content specifies "brick road," but the statement only mentions "road," which does not confirm if it's the same type of road.
3. The content does not provide any information about conversation or verbal interaction, leaving the possibility open but not confirmed.
4. The action of "sitting" in the content does not necessarily imply "talking," as the men could be silent or engaged in non-verbal activities.
