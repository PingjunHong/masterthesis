1. A professional swimmer cannot spit water out while simultaneously eating a toasted marshmallow, as the actions are mutually exclusive.
2. Spitting water out implies the swimmer's mouth is occupied with water, making it impossible to eat a toasted marshmallow at the same time.
3. The context of being in the water and needing assistance suggests a focus on swimming activity, not eating.
4. Handling both spitting water and eating a marshmallow requires different environments; one is typically done in water, the other on land.
