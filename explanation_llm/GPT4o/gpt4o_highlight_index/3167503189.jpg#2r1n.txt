1. The content does not mention any construction activity, so the addition of "as construction occurs" in the statement introduces a new detail that is not present in the content.
2. The presence of construction in the statement is an additional scenario that neither contradicts nor is implied by the content, making it neutral.
3. The highlighted portion in the statement adds context (construction) that is not necessary to understand the content, and its absence in the content does not affect the core meaning of a boy holding onto the wall.
4. The scenario of construction occurring could be true or false without affecting the factuality of the content, which focuses solely on the boy and the wall.
