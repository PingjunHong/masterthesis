- A very big grin suggests the woman is happy or in a positive mood, which contradicts the implication that she has been shot, as being shot would typically cause distress or pain.
- The presence of a very big grin indicates that the woman is physically capable of smiling, which is unlikely if she had just been shot and experiencing severe pain or injury.
- Being shot is a traumatic event that would typically prevent someone from smiling broadly, making the description of a very big grin inconsistent with someone who has been shot.
