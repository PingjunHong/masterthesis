1. The mention of "home" in the statement adds information not specified in the content, which does not indicate the destination of the mother and daughter.
2. The content describes the location as "the side of a bridge," whereas the statement implies a destination, "home," creating a context that could be true but is not necessarily inferred from the content alone.
3. The activity of walking in both sentences is consistent, but the purpose or destination of the walk is unspecified in the content, making the statement about walking home merely a possibility.
4. The content provides a setting but not an endpoint or purpose for the walk, leaving the statement's mention of "walking home" as an additional detail that neither contradicts nor is entailed by the content.
