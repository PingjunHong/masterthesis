1. The use of "The" in "The girls" specifies a particular group of girls but does not change the fundamental meaning that "Girls" in general can walk down the street.
2. The presence of the definite article "The" in the content sentence does not alter the truth of the statement that "Girls walk down the street," as both sentences describe the same action being performed by girls.
3. The definite article "The" is an identifier that helps specify which girls are being referred to, but the action and the subjects involved remain consistent with the statement that "Girls walk down the street."
4. The statement is a generalization of the specific case described in the content; both describe the same event involving girls walking down the street, making the statement a valid entailment.
