1. The term "old lady" in the statement does not specify the age or identity of the person in the content; the person in the content could be of any age or gender.
2. The content does not provide information about the street being busy, so the statement's mention of a "busy street" is an assumption not supported or contradicted by the content.
3. The content describes the person as "dressed in a dress with flowers and a stuffed bee attached to it," but this does not specify any age-related characteristics, leaving the possibility open that the person is not an "old lady."
