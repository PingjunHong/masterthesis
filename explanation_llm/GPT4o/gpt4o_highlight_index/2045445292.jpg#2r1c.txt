- Working to saw a log and having a beer are mutually exclusive activities, as one involves physical labor and the other involves relaxation or leisure.
- The act of sawing a log requires active engagement and physical effort, which contradicts the passive, relaxed state implied by having a beer.
- Being engaged in the task of sawing a log suggests they are focused on completing a specific work-related task, while having a beer implies they are taking a break or socializing, which are opposing scenarios.
- The context of working and the context of drinking are inherently different, with one being task-oriented and the other leisure-oriented, thus making them contradictory in nature.
