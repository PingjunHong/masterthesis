1. The activity "playing billiards" in both the content and the statement directly matches, indicating the same action is taking place.
2. The subject "a man" is consistent in both the content and the statement, referring to the same individual participating in the activity.
3. The location "at a bar" in the content specifies where the action is occurring but does not contradict the statement, which focuses solely on the action itself.
4. The omission of "at a bar" in the statement does not negate the action described, making the statement a more general description of the same event.
5. The content provides additional context about the location, but the core activity described—"a man is playing billiards"—remains unchanged, supporting entailment.
