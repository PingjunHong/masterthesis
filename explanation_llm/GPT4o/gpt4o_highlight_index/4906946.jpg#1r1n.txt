1. The statement mentions "men," but the content only describes "roadside workers," which may or may not specifically refer to men.
2. The action of "placing construction cones" in the statement is not confirmed in the content, which only mentions the presence of construction cones in the background.
3. The content provides no specific information about "preparation of a new pipeline building," making it unclear whether this activity is actually taking place.
4. The statement assumes a specific task related to a new pipeline, while the content does not provide enough details to confirm or deny this scenario.
5. The content does not specify the gender of the workers, while the statement explicitly refers to "men," which introduces a potential mismatch.
