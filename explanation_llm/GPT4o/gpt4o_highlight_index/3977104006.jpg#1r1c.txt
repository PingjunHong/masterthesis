- The men are playing brass instruments, indicating they are engaged in a musical activity, which contradicts the idea that they are watching a sports channel, an activity that would require their attention on a screen rather than on playing instruments.
- The context suggests the men are physically standing in a circle and involved in playing music, which is incompatible with the action of watching a sports channel that typically involves sitting and looking at a screen.
- The presence of an audience watching the men play brass instruments implies a public performance setting, which contradicts the private, passive activity of watching television.
- The physical action required to play brass instruments (using hands and mouth) is incompatible with the action of watching a sports channel, which typically does not involve such physical engagement.
