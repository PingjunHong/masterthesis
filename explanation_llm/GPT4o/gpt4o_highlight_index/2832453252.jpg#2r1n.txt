1. The activity of "playing in the water" does not necessarily mean the girls are swimming; they could be splashing, wading, or engaging in other water-related activities.
2. The statement "Four girls are swimming" specifies the action of swimming, which is just one possible interpretation of "playing in the water."
3. The content describes the girls as "young," which is not specified in the statement, leaving room for interpretation about the age of the girls.
4. The content does not specify the exact number of girls, using "four young girls," while the statement comments on "four girls," allowing for potential differences in the specificity of the group involved.
5. The content does not explicitly mention swimming, so while swimming is a form of playing in water, it is not the only activity they could be doing.
