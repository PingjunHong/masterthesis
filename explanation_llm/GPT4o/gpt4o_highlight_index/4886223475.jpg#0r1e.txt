1. The word "man" in both the content and the statement refers to the same individual, establishing a clear subject match.
2. Both sentences describe the action of "riding a bike," confirming that the activity being performed by the man is consistent in both the content and the statement.
3. The additional details in the content about the man's attire and the setting (e.g., "one piece tunic," "sandstone wall") do not contradict the statement but rather provide more context, supporting the core assertion that the man is riding a bike.
