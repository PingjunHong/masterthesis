1. The original content does not specify the destination or purpose of crossing the street, so the addition of "to get home" in the statement introduces information not present in the content, making it neutral.
2. The content only describes the action of crossing the street, while the statement assumes a reason for the action that is not mentioned in the content, maintaining neutrality.
3. The statement's assumption of a destination ("to get home") is not contradicted by the content, but it is also not supported, leaving the relationship between the two as neutral.
4. The fact that people are crossing the street does not inherently imply they are heading home, as they could be going anywhere, resulting in the statement adding a speculative detail.
