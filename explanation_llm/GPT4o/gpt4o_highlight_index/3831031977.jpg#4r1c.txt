- "Look down a mountain range" implies viewing the landscape below, while "look into the sky" suggests looking upwards.
- "Mountain range" indicates a terrestrial view, whereas "sky" refers to an aerial view.
- The act of looking "down" contrasts with looking "into" the sky, as these directions are opposite.
- Observing a "mountain range" is inconsistent with observing the "sky" as they require different focal points.
