1. The fact that a tree worker is cutting down a branch does not inherently indicate the tree's health status, as trees can be pruned for various reasons not related to being dead.
2. The action of cutting a branch can occur on both living and dead trees, so it does not confirm whether the tree is dead or alive.
3. The description of a tree worker wearing a hard hat and cutting a branch provides no specific information about the tree's vitality or appearance, leaving the tree's condition ambiguous.
4. Without additional context or visual cues from the tree itself, the condition of the tree remains unknown, making the statement about the tree being dead neither supported nor contradicted.
5. The worker's activity focuses on the action of cutting a branch rather than the state of the tree, thus not providing evidence for the tree being dead.
