1. The highlighted word "guys" in the statement does not specify gender in the content, as the content only mentions "a man" and "another person," leaving the gender of the second individual ambiguous.
2. The highlighted words "above the water" in the statement do not contradict the content, as the content describes individuals "speeding through the water," which could imply being partially or fully submerged, or above it, but does not explicitly state their exact position relative to the water's surface.
