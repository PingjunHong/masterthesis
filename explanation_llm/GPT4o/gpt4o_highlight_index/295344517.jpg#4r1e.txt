1. "A family" can be interpreted as "a group of people," since a family is a subset of a group.
2. "Walking" and "strolling" are synonymous actions, both indicating a leisurely or casual movement on foot.
3. "With a soldier" does not contradict "a group of people," as a soldier can be part of the group, and the presence of a soldier doesn't negate the group context.
