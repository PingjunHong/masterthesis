1. The size of the dog is not mentioned in the content, so it is unclear whether the dog is big.
2. The content does not specify that the dog is playing; it only mentions that the dog is running, which could be unrelated to playing.
3. The content does not mention a toy, so it is uncertain whether the dog is interacting with a toy.
4. The activity described in the content (running) does not imply playing with a toy, leaving room for other interpretations.
5. The environment described (grass outdoors in front of a sidewalk) does not inherently indicate the presence of toys or playing.
