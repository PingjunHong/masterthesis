1. The content does not specify the event as St Patrick's Day, so it could be any parade or festival, making the specific reference in the statement neutral.
2. The statement mentions workers, which aligns with the content's reference to cleaners, but does not further specify the type of workers beyond the context of cleaning, leaving room for interpretation.
3. The activity described in the content (sweeping up animal feces) is not explicitly linked to St Patrick's Day, as the statement suggests, allowing for multiple possible events where such cleaning might occur.
4. The content does not provide a timeframe or specific cultural context, while the statement introduces a specific holiday, which is additional information not confirmed or contradicted by the content.
5. The statement implies a specific occasion (St Patrick's Day) that is not mentioned in the content, creating a neutral relationship since the content allows for any parade or festival scenario.
