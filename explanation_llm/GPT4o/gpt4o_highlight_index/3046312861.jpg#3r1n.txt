1. The statement about the gymnast training for the Olympics introduces additional information not present in the content, which only mentions her being coached on bar skills, without specifying the purpose or level of competition.
2. The content does not provide any details about the gymnast's goals or level of training, so the statement about the Olympics remains speculative and unsupported.
3. Being coached on bar skills could be part of various training programs, not necessarily for the Olympics; thus, the statement about Olympic training is not directly inferable from the content.
4. The content focuses on the action of being coached, while the statement infers a specific intent (training for the Olympics) that is not explicitly mentioned.
5. The statement assumes a future intention (Olympic training) that is not evident in the content, which merely describes a present action (coaching on bar skills) without indicating any specific future events or goals.
6. The content does not provide any information about the gymnast's level of expertise or competition, leaving the Olympic training assertion as a neutral possibility rather than a definite conclusion.
