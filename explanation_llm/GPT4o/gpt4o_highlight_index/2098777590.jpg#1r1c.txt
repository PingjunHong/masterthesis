- The highlighted word "woman" in the content contradicts the highlighted word "man" in the statement because they refer to different genders.
- The activity described in the content, "preparing food," contradicts the activity in the statement, "cleans," as these are two different actions.
- The roles or activities performed by the individuals in the content and statement are different, suggesting they are not the same person.
