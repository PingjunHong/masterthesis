- The skier performing a ski-jump may not necessarily be in the role of teaching; they could simply be showcasing their skills.
- The two other skiers watching might not be learning the trick; they could be observing for entertainment or other reasons.
- There is no explicit indication in the content that the skiing act involves a teaching scenario.
- The act of ski-jumping and the act of teaching are distinct activities and the presence of an audience does not imply a teaching context.
- The watching skiers could already know the trick being performed, thus negating a teaching element.
