1. The statement adds the word "old" to describe the meat, but there is no indication in the content that specifies the age or freshness of the meat.
2. The content does not provide any information about the condition or quality of the meat, so the addition of "old" in the statement does not contradict the content.
3. The term "old" is an additional detail not present in the content, and without further context, it does not alter the core action or scenario described.
4. The content simply mentions "meat" without qualifying it with descriptors, making the inclusion of "old" in the statement an assumption rather than a contradiction.
