1. The activity of "using scissors to cut something" implies the boy is awake and engaged in an action, which contradicts the state of "sleeping" where the boy is inactive and not conscious.
2. Cutting with scissors requires focus and coordination, which is not possible if the boy is sleeping, as sleep involves a lack of interaction with the environment.
3. The verb "using" indicates an ongoing action, whereas "sleeping" denotes a passive state, making it impossible for both to occur simultaneously.
