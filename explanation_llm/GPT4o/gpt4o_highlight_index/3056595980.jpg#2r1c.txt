- The highlighted word "coast" in the content indicates a seaside or ocean view, while the highlighted word "forest" in the statement suggests a wooded area, which are two distinct and incompatible environments.
- Being at the coast involves being near a body of water, while being in a forest involves being surrounded by trees, making it impossible for the women to be looking at both simultaneously.
- The setting described in the content implies an open, possibly expansive view associated with the coast, whereas the statement describes a setting that is typically enclosed by trees, which are characteristic of a forest.
