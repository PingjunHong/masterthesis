2. The villagers could be pulling in the fish boat after fishing, rather than preparing to go.
3. The action of pulling in the fish boat does not specify a timeline or intention, so it does not directly imply preparation for fishing.
4. The villagers could be moving the boat for maintenance, storage, or other reasons unrelated to fishing preparation.
5. The statement assumes future intention (going fishing), which is not directly supported by the content description.
