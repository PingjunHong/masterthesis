1. The action of "walking down the street" does not specify a destination, so it is unclear if the girls are going to the park or elsewhere.
2. The statement mentions "going to the park," which introduces a specific destination not mentioned in the content, creating ambiguity about the actual destination.
3. While walking down the street could lead to the park, it could also lead to other places, so there is no direct implication that the park is the destination.
4. The content does not provide enough context to confirm or deny the park as the destination, making the relationship between the two statements neutral.
5. The time frame and purpose of the walking are unspecified, leaving open the possibility that the park is merely one of many potential destinations.
