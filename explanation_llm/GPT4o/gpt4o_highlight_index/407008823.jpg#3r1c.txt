1. "Jump" and "slide" describe different actions; jumping implies an upward and forward motion, while sliding involves moving smoothly along a surface.
2. Jumping typically involves using one's own physical strength to propel, whereas sliding often involves a surface or object facilitating movement.
3. Jumping over a crevasse implies overcoming a gap by an aerial leap, while sliding over a crevasse suggests a continuous motion along a surface which would not involve being airborne.
