- The highlighted words in the content indicate that the choir is singing at a church, while the statement suggests they are at a baseball game, which are two distinct and mutually exclusive locations.
- The context implies a religious or spiritual setting due to the mention of a church and a book, whereas the statement places the choir in a secular, sports-related environment.
- Singing joyous songs from a book at a church suggests a liturgical or worship context, which contradicts the casual and entertainment-focused setting of a baseball game.
- The phrase "to the masses" in the content suggests a congregation or assembly typical in religious settings, conflicting with the term "baseball game," which involves spectators and fans in a sports arena.
