1. The statement introduces new information by specifying the recipient as "his son," which is not mentioned in the content, thus maintaining neutrality.
2. The content suggests the man is in the process of trying to throw, whereas the statement implies the action of throwing is already completed, creating a difference in action status.
3. The relationship between the man and the recipient ("his son") is not specified in the content, so the statement adds an assumption that cannot be verified.
4. The content describes the man's clothing ("black t-shirt") which is not mentioned in the statement, leading to a difference in description that keeps the statement neutral.
5. The action in the content is described as an attempt ("trying to throw"), whereas the statement asserts the action has been executed, reflecting a potential difference in the outcome.
6. The statement provides a specific target for the action ("to his son"), which is absent in the content, leading to ambiguity regarding the destination of the throw.
