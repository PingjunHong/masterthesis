1. Playing a violin within an orchestra does not necessarily imply that the woman is playing a concert, as she could be rehearsing or performing in a non-concert setting.
2. The term "concert" involves a specific type of musical performance, but the act of playing a violin does not specify the context or setting of the performance.
3. The woman could be playing in a practice session, recording session, or any other musical event that is not a formal concert.
