1. The term "sedan" in the statement is a type of car, and while it could refer to a Ford car, it does not specify the brand, making it neutral.
2. The word "corner" in the statement could imply a right turn, but it does not explicitly state the direction, so it remains ambiguous.
3. The term "walkers" is used in the statement, which is a general term and does not specify the number of individuals, whereas the content specifies "3 males."
4. The statement provides a general description of a car turning and people crossing, which aligns with the content but lacks specific details like the number of people and the direction of the turn, leading to a neutral interpretation.
