- The act of looking down at a child in the bath typically involves attention and observation, which is inconsistent with the child being asleep, as sleeping implies a lack of interaction or awareness.
- A child in the bath usually suggests they are engaged in some activity related to bathing, such as playing or washing, rather than sleeping, which requires a restful and undisturbed state.
- The presence of a group of adults implies supervision or engagement with the child, which contradicts the scenario of the child being asleep, as sleeping would not necessitate such attention.
- The setting of a bathroom, especially when a child is in the bath, is more aligned with activity or vigilance, contrasting with the calm, undisturbed environment typically associated with sleeping.
