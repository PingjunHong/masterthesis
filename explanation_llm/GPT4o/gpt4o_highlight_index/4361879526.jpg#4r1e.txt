1. The term "men" in the content is a specific type of "people" in the statement, making the statement a generalized version of the content.
2. Both the content and the statement describe the same number of individuals, with "two" being explicitly mentioned in both, ensuring numerical consistency.
3. The actions described ("climbing on a wooden scaffold") are identical in both content and statement, maintaining semantic consistency between them.
4. The use of "men" in the content implies that "people" in the statement is inclusive of men, which aligns with the entailment logic where a more precise term (men) supports a broader term (people).
