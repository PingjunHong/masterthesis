1. The presence of pedestrians on a crowded city street does not necessarily indicate they are waiting for a parade; they could be there for various reasons, such as shopping, commuting, or sightseeing.
2. The word "waiting" suggests a specific action or intent by the pedestrians, which cannot be confirmed solely by observing the crowded street.
3. While a busy street might host a parade, the description of "lots of pedestrians" does not explicitly mention any event, making the statement about waiting for a parade speculative.
4. The term "parade" introduces a specific event that is not mentioned in the original content, leaving room for other interpretations of the pedestrians' presence.
