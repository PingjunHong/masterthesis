1. The roles and activities of "two men wearing dirty clothing" and "two research scientists" are distinct, with no direct connection implied between begging and conducting research.
2. The context of sitting on a sidewalk with a dog does not directly relate to the professional activity of conducting research, making it unclear if they are the same individuals.
3. The use of "disguise" introduces ambiguity; there is no indication that the men on the sidewalk are intentionally disguising themselves as beggars to conduct research.
4. The term "conduct research" implies a formal or structured activity, which is not evident in the description of sitting and begging.
5. The absence of any explicit mention of research or scientific activity in the context makes it uncertain if the men are indeed the scientists in disguise.
