1. The highlighted parts in the content indicate that three people are on the edge of the roof, suggesting they are stationary and at a high position, while the highlighted parts in the statement imply they are actively climbing down, which contradicts the notion of being on the roof's edge.
2. The content suggests that the crowd is looking up at the three people, which implies that these people are in a high location, whereas the statement suggests they are climbing down, which would not require the crowd to look up.
3. The act of being on the edge of the roof implies a static position, while climbing down the ladder involves movement away from that position, leading to a contradiction between being on the roof's edge and descending.
4. The presence of a ladder in the statement suggests a means of descent, whereas the content does not mention a ladder, focusing instead on the position of being on the roof's edge, contradicting the notion of descent.
5. The statement describes an action (climbing down) that is inconsistent with the described position (on the edge of the roof) in the content, as one cannot be both on the edge and actively climbing down simultaneously.
