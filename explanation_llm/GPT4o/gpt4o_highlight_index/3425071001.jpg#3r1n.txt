1. The action of hitting a tennis ball does not necessarily indicate skill level; the boy could be practicing or casually playing without being good at tennis.

3. The content provides information about an activity (hitting a tennis ball), but it does not provide any assessment or evidence of the boy's proficiency or competency in tennis.
4. There is no information in the content regarding the boy's technique, accuracy, or consistency, which would be necessary to determine if he is good at tennis.
5. The content describes a singular event, which is insufficient to gauge overall ability or skill level in tennis.
