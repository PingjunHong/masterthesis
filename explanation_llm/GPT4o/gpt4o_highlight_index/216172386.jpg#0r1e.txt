1. The term "man" is a specific type of "person," making it clear that a man is indeed a person.
2. "Wearing a red uniform and helmet" provides additional descriptive detail but does not change the fact that the subject is still a "person."
3. "Stands on his motorbike" implies the man is in an upright position, which aligns with the concept of "standing."
4. The action "stands on his motorbike" includes the act of standing, therefore confirming the action described in the statement.
5. The uniform and helmet are not relevant to the fundamental action of standing, so they do not negate the statement's premise of a "person standing."
