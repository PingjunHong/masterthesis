- "Icy road" suggests a surface covered with ice, whereas "dry highway" indicates a surface without moisture or ice, creating a contradiction in the type of ground the women are walking on.
- The environmental conditions implied by "icy road" and "dry highway" are mutually exclusive, as a road cannot be both icy and dry at the same time.
- The presence of ice on a road would prevent it from being considered dry, which conflicts with the description of the highway as dry.
- The term "icy" implies cold and potentially hazardous conditions, while "dry" suggests the absence of such conditions, leading to a contradiction in the scene's setting.
