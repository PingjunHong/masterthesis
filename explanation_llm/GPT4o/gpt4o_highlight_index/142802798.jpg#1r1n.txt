1. The original content does not specify the pace at which the boy is skateboarding, so the addition of "at a fast pace" in the statement introduces new information not confirmed by the content.
2. The content does not mention the boy's hair length, so describing the boy as "long-haired" adds a detail that is not present or implied in the original content.
3. The content includes "in a green shirt," which is not addressed in the statement, making it unclear if the statement describes the same scenario or person.
