- The hypothesis specifies that the boy rides "by two cows," which could imply a different spatial relationship than "between two cows" as stated in the premise.
- The use of "between" in the premise indicates the boy is situated with a cow on each side, which could logically conflict with the idea of "by" if interpreted as alongside rather than between.
