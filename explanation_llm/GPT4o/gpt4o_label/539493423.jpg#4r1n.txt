- The size of the fire is not specified in the content.
- The content only mentions a torch of fire, which does not inherently indicate the size of the fire.
- A torch can have varying sizes of flames, and "holding a torch" does not suggest the fire's largeness.
- The statement about the fire being large introduces additional information not present in the content.
- The content is compatible with both small and large fires, so the size remains indeterminate.
- The description focuses on the act of holding a torch, not on the attributes of the fire itself.
