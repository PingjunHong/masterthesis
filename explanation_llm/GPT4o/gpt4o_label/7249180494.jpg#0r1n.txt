1. The content does not provide any information about the swimmer's experience underwater or the presence of a fast current, so it's unclear whether the swimmer almost drowned.
2. The act of spitting out water and being helped to land does not necessarily imply a near-drowning experience; it could be a routine part of the swimmer's activity.
3. There is no mention of any danger or distress in the content, which could be necessary to support the statement that the swimmer almost drowned.
4. The statement introduces an element (a fast current) that is absent from the content, making it speculative rather than directly supported.
5. The content focuses on the actions of spitting water and being helped, which could occur for reasons other than near-drowning, such as exhaustion or an exercise routine.
6. The content does not specify the swimmer's condition or emotions, leaving the severity of the situation ambiguous.
7. The statement includes an interpretation of the swimmer's experience (almost drowning) that is not explicitly confirmed by the details in the content.
