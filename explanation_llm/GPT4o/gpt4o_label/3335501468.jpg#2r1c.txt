- The bird is on the water, which contradicts the idea of it being in the air above the trees.
- Flapping its wings on the water suggests the bird is at or near the water's surface, not flying at a higher altitude over trees.
- The physical location of the bird being on the water conflicts with the stated location of flying over trees.
- The action of flapping wings on water implies a different behavior or activity than flying over trees.
- Trees are typically taller than the water surface, making it unlikely for a bird at the water level to be simultaneously over the trees.
