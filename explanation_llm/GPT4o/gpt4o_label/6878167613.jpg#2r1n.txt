- "Getting ready to putt" can be interpreted as "readies to putt," meaning the actions described are essentially the same.
- The presence of a crowd watching implies that the event is happening in the present, aligning with the statement's use of "readies."
- The term "on the green" in the content suggests the location where putting occurs, supporting the action mentioned in the statement.
- The general context of golf includes putting a ball, so omitting the word "ball" in the statement does not change the meaning since it is implied by the context.
- There is no contradiction between the content and the statement, and both convey a similar scenario involving a golfer preparing to putt.
