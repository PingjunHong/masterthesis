- The content does not specify the boy's age, so the statement about being ten years old is neither supported nor contradicted.
- The action of getting ready to kick a soccer ball is not inherently linked to a specific age, allowing for multiple possible ages.
- The content focuses on the action rather than any personal details like age, keeping the statement about age neutral.
- The concept of a "little boy" is subjective and could include a range of ages, including ten years old.
- The statement introduces new information (the boy's exact age) not addressed in the content, making it unrelated in terms of veracity.
