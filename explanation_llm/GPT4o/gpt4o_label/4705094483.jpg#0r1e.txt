1. The statement provides a more general description by omitting the specific color of the shirt, which does not affect the truth of the statement.
2. The context and actions described in the content (being in a commercial kitchen and holding up meat) are identical in the statement.
3. The content's details about the setting and the man's actions are preserved in the statement, making the statement a less specific but accurate representation of the content.
4. Removing the adjective "black" from "black shirt" does not alter the fundamental activity or setting described, allowing the statement to be logically inferred from the content.
