- Jumping and sliding are distinct actions with different physical movements, making them mutually exclusive in this context.
- A rope and a slide are different objects used for different purposes, contradicting the means of crossing the crevasse.
- The use of a rope implies an active, dynamic action, whereas a slide suggests a passive, controlled descent, creating a contradiction in activity type.
- Sliding typically involves a smooth, continuous surface, which is inconsistent with the act of jumping that involves a gap and a dynamic leap.
- The presence of a rope suggests a need for climbing or swinging, which contradicts the structured and fixed nature of a slide.
