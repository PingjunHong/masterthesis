1. Volleyball and soccer are distinct sports with different rules, equipment, and playing styles, so seeing women playing volleyball implies they are not playing soccer.
2. Volleyball is typically played with a net and a volleyball, contrasting with soccer, which is played with a ball at the feet on a field without a net (except for the goal), thus making soccer an unlikely activity given the description.
3. The context of women playing volleyball suggests an indoor or sand court setting, which differs from the usual grass or turf field associated with soccer, reinforcing the notion that the scene is not a soccer game.
4. The immediate visual cues associated with volleyball, such as the presence of a net and the use of hands to play the ball, do not align with soccer's gameplay, which involves kicking the ball and does not involve a net in the middle of the field.
5. The attire and gear typically worn in volleyball, like knee pads and specific athletic wear, differ from soccer uniforms, further indicating that the observed activity is not soccer.
