1. The content does not provide any information about weather conditions, such as rain, so the statement introduces new information that is not addressed in the content.
2. The content describes men in hard hats, but the statement uses the term "guys," which could refer to the same individuals but does not specify their attire, leaving the connection open to interpretation.
3. The content mentions "work along a wall," while the statement specifies "working near a wall," which is a subtle difference that does not contradict but does not confirm the exact same scenario.
4. The content does not specify the weather or any changes in weather conditions, so the mention of rain in the statement is an addition that is neither supported nor refuted by the content.
5. The statement introduces a temporal element ("it starts raining") that is not present in the content, which only describes a static scene of men working.
