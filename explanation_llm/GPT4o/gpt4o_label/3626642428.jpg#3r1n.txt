- The content describes dogs swimming in a river, but it does not specify the direction or purpose of their swimming, so it is unclear if they are swimming across the river.
- The statement involves the dogs swimming from one side to the other, which is not explicitly mentioned in the content.
- The act of swimming across implies a destination or goal, while the content only mentions the activity of swimming.
- The content doesn't provide details on the movement or path of the dogs, leaving the possibility of them swimming across open but not confirmed.
- The statement adds a specific movement (across) that is not contradicted by, but also not supported by, the content.
