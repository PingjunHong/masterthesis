- The content does not specify the hair color of the woman, so it is unknown if she is blonde.
- The content does not mention whether the woman is dancing, only that she is singing.
- The term "goofy looking" is subjective and does not necessarily contradict the statement about her appearance or actions.
- The content and the statement both agree that a woman is singing on the stage, but additional details in the statement (such as dancing and being blonde) are not confirmed by the content.
- The statement introduces new information (blonde hair and dancing) that is not addressed in the content, making it neither supported nor contradicted.
