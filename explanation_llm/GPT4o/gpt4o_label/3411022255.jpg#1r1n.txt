- The content does not specify the destination or purpose of crossing the street, so the statement's mention of "to get home" introduces new information not present in the content.
- The content focuses solely on the action of crossing the street, while the statement adds an inferred motive or intention that cannot be confirmed from the content alone.
- There is no indication in the content about where the people and the baby are heading, meaning the statement's addition of "to get home" is not necessarily true or false based on the provided information.
- The content provides a factual description of the event without any mention of the participants' goals, making the statement's claim about their destination speculative rather than directly supported by the content.
