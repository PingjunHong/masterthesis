- Jumping implies that the person is temporarily airborne, so if the girl is jumping, she must be in the air at some point.
- The action of jumping inherently includes a phase where the person is off the ground, confirming that the girl is in the air.
- The description "jumping up" suggests an upward motion that includes leaving the ground, which means the girl is in the air during this action.
- The phrase "in red" in both the content and the statement ensures that they refer to the same person, linking the action directly to the girl being airborne.
