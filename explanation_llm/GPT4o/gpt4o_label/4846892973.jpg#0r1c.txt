- The statement claims that the people are in a boat, while the content describes them as standing on a pier, indicating they are on solid ground rather than on water.
- The presence of a table and a pair of glasses in the foreground suggests a stable setting, which is inconsistent with the typically less stable environment of a boat.
- A pier is a stationary structure extending into the water, contrasting with a boat, which is a movable vessel on water.
- The description of people "standing on a pier" implies they are on a fixed location, while being "in a boat" implies movement or potential for movement on water.
- The term "pier" specifically denotes a platform on the water's edge, separate from being on a vessel like a boat.
