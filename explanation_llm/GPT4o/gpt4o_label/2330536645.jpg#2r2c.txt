- Playing in the water and playing mini golf are mutually exclusive activities that cannot occur simultaneously in the same context.
- The environments for playing in the water and playing mini golf are different, implying the children cannot be in both at the same time.
- The activities described (water play vs. mini golf) involve different equipment and setups, making it improbable for them to happen concurrently.
- The statement specifies "mini golf," which does not involve water, contradicting the content where children are explicitly playing in water.
