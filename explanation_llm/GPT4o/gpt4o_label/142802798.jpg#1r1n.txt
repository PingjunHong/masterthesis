- The content mentions a boy in a green shirt on a skateboard, but the statement adds that the boy has long hair, which is not confirmed or denied by the content.
- The content does not specify the speed at which the boy is skateboarding, while the statement describes him riding at a fast pace, introducing an element not covered in the content.
- The content and statement both involve a stone wall with graffiti and a boy on a skateboard, which aligns, but the additional details in the statement about the boy's hair and speed are not addressed in the content, making the statement neither supported nor contradicted.
- The content does not provide enough detail about the boy's physical characteristics or actions beyond being on a skateboard, so the additional information in the statement is not verifiable from the content.
