- The content does not specify the duration of the men's activity, so it does not confirm whether they have been fishing all day.
- The content only mentions the preparation of a fish at a dock, which does not inherently imply that the men were fishing prior to this activity.
- The statement suggests a timeline ("just come in from"), but the content does not provide any information about the timeline of events, leaving the relationship between fishing and preparing the fish ambiguous.
- The content does not specify the origin of the fish, so it is unclear if the fish was caught by the men or sourced from elsewhere.
- The location described (a dock) is consistent with fishing activities, but the content alone does not confirm the men's participation in fishing.
- The content does not indicate the men's prior activities or whether they were engaged in fishing specifically, so the statement remains unverified.
- The statement introduces a specific duration ("all day") that is not addressed or contradicted by the content, leaving the time spent fishing uncertain.
