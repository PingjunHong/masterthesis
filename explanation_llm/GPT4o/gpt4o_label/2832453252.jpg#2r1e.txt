- The statement specifies "four girls," which matches "four young girls" from the content.
- The action "playing in the water" implies that the girls are indeed "in the water."
- The content does not mention any other location, supporting the inference that the girls are in the water.
- The omission of "young" in the statement does not contradict the content, as all young girls are still girls.
