1. The duck is described as expanding its wings, indicating active movement rather than sleeping.
2. The action of expanding wings suggests the duck is awake and alert, not asleep.
3. Sleep implies inactivity or rest, whereas expanding its wings suggests the duck is engaged in activity.
4. The statement implies stillness ("sleeps soundly"), which contradicts the dynamic action of wing expansion.
