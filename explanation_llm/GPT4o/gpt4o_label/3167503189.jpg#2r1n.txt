- The content does not mention any construction occurring, so the statement introduces new information that is neither directly supported nor contradicted by the content.
- The presence of construction is an additional detail that is not implied or refuted by the content about a boy holding onto the wall.
- The content is focused solely on the boy's action and the setting, without any reference to construction, making the statement an elaboration that does not alter the factuality of the original description.
- The statement could be true if construction is happening elsewhere or at another time, but this is not addressed in the content, leaving it as a neutral possibility.
- The notion of construction does not inherently change the scene described in the content; it adds context that does not impact the boy's action or the description of the house.
