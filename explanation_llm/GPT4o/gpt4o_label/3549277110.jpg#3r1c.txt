- Reading a book is an activity that involves looking at written or printed material, while watching a show involves viewing video content.
- The content specifies the boys are engaged with books, not a show, indicating different activities.
- Books and shows are distinct mediums; one is text-based and the other is visual/auditory.
- The action of reading does not entail the action of watching.
- The setting implied by reading books is typically different from that of watching a show.
- The focus of the content is on the act of reading, not on visual media consumption.
