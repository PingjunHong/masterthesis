- The statement does not specify the nature of the event being watched, similar to the content.
- Both the content and the statement involve a group of people, but the statement does not clarify what they are watching or why, which is consistent with the content.
- The statement indicates that the people are looking in the same direction, which could be implied by them watching an event, but it does not add specific details about the event or the context.
- The statement uses "humans" instead of "people," which doesn't change the overall meaning but does not provide additional information that would make it more specific or contradictory.
- There is no explicit mention of the time of day in the statement, so it neither confirms nor contradicts the fact that the event occurs at night as mentioned in the content.
- The direction they are looking is not specified in the content, so this lack of detail maintains neutrality.
