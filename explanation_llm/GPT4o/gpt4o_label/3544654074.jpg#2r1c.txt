- A couple cannot be simultaneously newlywed and divorced.
- Being newlywed implies recent marriage, conflicting with the state of being divorced.
- The context of laughing and talking suggests a harmonious relationship, inconsistent with divorce.
- The term "newlywed" inherently means the couple is still married.
