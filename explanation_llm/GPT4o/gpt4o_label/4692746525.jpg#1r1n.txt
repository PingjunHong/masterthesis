- The content does not specify the emotions or intentions of the people in the crowd or the old man, leaving ambiguity around the term "angry".
- The statement assumes the old man is a military veteran, but the content only describes him wearing a military cap, which does not confirm his veteran status.

- The content does not specify the old man's actions or focus, so it is ambiguous whether he is actively watching or participating in any specific event.
