- The content does not specify what is being poured into the kettle, leaving it open to interpretation and making "salsa" a possible but unconfirmed option.
- The term "soon" in the statement suggests a future action that is not explicitly described in the content, thus introducing an element of uncertainty.
- The content describes the scene without mentioning the specific substance being poured, so the statement about salsa neither contradicts nor is supported by the content.
- The content does not provide enough detail about the substance being poured to determine whether it is salsa or not, so the statement remains unverified but plausible.
