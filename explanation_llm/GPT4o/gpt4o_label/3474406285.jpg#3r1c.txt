- A dog cannot be jumping over an obstacle and simultaneously be in a pool.
- The environments suggested by the actions are incompatible; jumping over an obstacle typically occurs on solid ground, not in water.
- Pools are bodies of water, and being in a pool implies the dog is at least partially submerged, which contradicts the action of jumping.
- The action "jumps over an obstacle" implies a dry surface, while being "in a pool" suggests a wet environment.
