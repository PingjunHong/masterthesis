- The content does not mention the presence of children, only spectators.
- The content specifically describes the scene with a female runner and spectators, with no indication that any of the spectators are children.
- The use of "spectators" does not inherently imply the presence of children, and without explicit mention, it contradicts the statement about children being in the streets.
- The context of a competition with spectators suggests an organized event, where children might not be present or highlighted in the description.
- If the street is lined with spectators, it implies a crowd primarily focused on watching the race, and the specific mention of children is absent, making the statement contradictory.
