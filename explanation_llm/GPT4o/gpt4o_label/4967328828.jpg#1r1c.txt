The items of clothing described are mutually exclusive; a bikini is not a prom dress. The context describes a casual, leisure setting by the water, which typically does not involve wearing formal attire like a prom dress. The colorful bikini mentioned implies minimal coverage, while a prom dress generally provides more coverage and is elaborate. The setting by the water and the activity of resting imply casual or swimwear, not formalwear.
