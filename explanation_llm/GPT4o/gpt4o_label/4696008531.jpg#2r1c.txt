- Throwing and walking away are mutually exclusive actions, as one typically involves a stationary or focused posture, while the other involves movement in the opposite direction.
- The act of trying to throw suggests intention to engage with an object, whereas walking away implies disengagement or leaving the scene.
- The statement implies a change in location, whereas throwing requires proximity to the object being thrown.
- The statement suggests a lack of interaction or continuation of the current activity, which contradicts the active engagement suggested by trying to throw.
