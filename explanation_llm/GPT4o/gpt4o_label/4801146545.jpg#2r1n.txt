- The statement specifies "men," while the content uses "people," which includes all genders.
- The content does not specify the gender of the people walking, so it is unclear if they are all men.
- The content mentions people wearing "only white and red," while the statement describes them as "in red and white," which might imply a different emphasis or order, though this is minor.
- The statement and content both describe a large number of people but differ slightly in focus on gender, which is not explicitly confirmed or denied by the content.
