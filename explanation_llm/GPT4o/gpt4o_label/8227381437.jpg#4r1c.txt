- A shoemaker is typically an adult, not a child nearing their 16th birthday.
- The term "old" suggests advanced age, conflicting with being 15 years old.
- Being referred to as "an old shoemaker" implies significant life and work experience, not consistent with a teenager.
- The context of working in a factory is unlikely for someone who is only 15 years old.
