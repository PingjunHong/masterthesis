1. "Four people and a baby are crossing the street at a crosswalk" cannot be rephrased as "People and a baby riding the bus" because "crossing the street" and "riding the bus" describe different actions.
2. The structure of "crossing the street at a crosswalk" implies movement on foot, contrasting with "riding the bus," which implies being inside a vehicle.
3. The syntactic structure of "crossing the street" focuses on pedestrian activity, whereas "riding the bus" suggests traveling by public transport, making them contradictory.
4. "Crossing the street" and "riding the bus" are actions that cannot happen simultaneously in the same context, structurally opposing each other.
5. The phrase "at a crosswalk" indicates a specific pedestrian location, which is structurally incompatible with "on a bus," a vehicle-specific location.
6. "Four people and a baby" engaging in "crossing the street" is a rephrase that structurally cannot match "People and a baby riding the bus," as the former implies walking and the latter implies being seated inside a vehicle.
7. The syntactic alternation of "crossing the street" involves a pedestrian context, while "riding the bus" involves a transit context, leading to a structural contradiction.
