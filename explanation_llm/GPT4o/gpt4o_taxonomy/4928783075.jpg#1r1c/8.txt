1. A boy standing in a field cannot be indoors at the same time.
2. Throwing a toy plane outdoors contradicts playing video games, which is an indoor activity.

4. Playing video games typically requires electronic devices, which are not mentioned in the premise involving a toy plane.
5. The actions described (throwing a toy plane) are incompatible with video gaming, which involves interaction with a screen or console.
6. The attire mentioned (red shirt and jeans) is typical for outdoor play, whereas playing video games indoors does not necessitate such clothing.

8. The setting described as "a field" inherently contradicts the indoor environment required for playing video games.
9. The premise involves physical interaction with a toy, which is contrary to the virtual interaction required for video gaming.
10. Real-world logic dictates that one cannot simultaneously engage in outdoor physical play and indoor video gaming.
