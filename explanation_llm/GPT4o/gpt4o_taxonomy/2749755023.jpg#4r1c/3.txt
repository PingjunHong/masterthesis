1. A woman in a black shirt cannot be rephrased as a woman in green, as these descriptions imply different colors of clothing.
2. Looking at a bicycle cannot be structurally rephrased to mean sleeps on a couch, as these actions are fundamentally different.
3. The action of looking and the action of sleeping are not syntactic rephrases of each other; they describe incompatible activities.
4. The location and activity described in a woman in a black shirt looking at a bicycle cannot be rephrased to match the location and activity in A woman in green sleeps on a couch, as they involve different settings and actions.
5. A woman in a black shirt cannot be syntactically altered to mean a woman in green, as they indicate different appearances.
6. The premise involves an active engagement with a bicycle, while the hypothesis suggests a passive state on a couch, which cannot be rephrased to mean the same thing.
7. The structural elements of looking at a bicycle do not align with the structural elements of sleeps on a couch, making them irreconcilable through syntactic rephrasing.
8. The description of clothing color in the premise (black) and the hypothesis (green) represent a contradiction that cannot be resolved through syntactic alternation.
9. The act of observing or engaging with an object such as a bicycle is syntactically distinct from the act of sleeping, which involves rest, thus creating a contradiction.
