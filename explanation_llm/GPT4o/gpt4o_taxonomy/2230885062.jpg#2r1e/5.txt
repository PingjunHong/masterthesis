1. The hypothesis does not specify the gender of the people, whereas the premise mentions two women, but it is entailed because 'people' can include any gender.
2. The hypothesis omits details about what the women are wearing or holding, yet it remains true since the key detail is that two people are standing on the grass.
3. The premise includes specific actions and objects such as holding a cup and saucer, which are not mentioned in the hypothesis, but the absence of these details does not affect the truth of the statement that two people are standing on the grass.
4. The hypothesis does not mention whether the people are wearing dresses, but the premise confirms their presence on the grass, which supports the entailment.
5. The hypothesis does not mention the exact number of people holding objects, but the premise confirms two individuals on the grass, making the hypothesis entailed.
6. The hypothesis does not specify the location beyond 'grass,' whereas the premise mentions 'outside,' yet the hypothesis is entailed because both indicate presence on grass.
