1. Running is an activity performed on foot, while riding bikes involves using bicycles, which are mutually exclusive actions.
2. The presence of numbers on shirts suggests participation in a running event, which precludes the activity of riding bikes.
3. The verb "running" indicates movement with legs, whereas "riding bikes" requires bicycles, leading to a contradiction in the description of the activity.
4. The structure of the sentence implies that the activity involves running, which logically conflicts with the activity of riding bikes since both cannot occur simultaneously.
5. The semantics of "running" inherently exclude any form of bicycling, thereby contradicting the idea of the ladies being on bikes.
6. The description of "3 ladies with numbers on their shirts" aligns with competitive running events, not biking events, leading to a contradiction with the notion of riding bikes.
