- A crowded city street with lots of pedestrians does not necessarily imply the presence of many motorcyclists.
- The presence of pedestrians does not causally relate to the presence of motorcyclists.
- While the city street is crowded, it does not specify the types of vehicles present, including motorcyclists.
- Many pedestrians on a street do not probabilistically indicate a high number of motorcyclists.
- The premise mentions pedestrians but does not provide any information about motorcyclists being on the road.
- Real-world experience suggests that crowded pedestrian areas might have fewer motorcyclists due to limited space, but this is not explicitly stated.
- The premise does not assume any correlation between pedestrian density and motorcyclist presence.
- The existence of motorcyclists is not implied or inherently connected to the description of lots of pedestrians.
- A crowded city street can have varying traffic compositions, and the presence of pedestrians does not inherently determine the presence of motorcyclists.
- The street's crowded nature with pedestrians does not logically lead to a conclusion about the number of motorcyclists.
