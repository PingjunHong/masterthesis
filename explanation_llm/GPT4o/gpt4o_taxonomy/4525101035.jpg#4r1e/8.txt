1. A man standing with his arms spread would naturally be in an upright position, as spreading arms typically requires standing up.
2. The act of standing inherently means being in an upright position, as it is the default orientation for a standing posture.
3. In order to spread one's arms effectively, a person generally needs to be upright to maintain balance and achieve the desired posture.
4. The phrase "stands with his arms spread" suggests an open and upright stance, which aligns with the hypothesis that the man is upright.
5. Real-world knowledge about human posture indicates that spreading arms while standing is usually done when one is upright.
6. Being upright is a necessary condition for standing with arms spread; therefore, the premise logically entails the hypothesis.
7. The posture described in the premise implies an upright orientation due to the gravitational and balance requirements of standing with arms extended.
8. In everyday scenarios, "standing" is synonymous with being upright, reinforcing the entailment of the hypothesis from the premise.
9. The term "stands" directly infers an upright position, which is critical for the action of spreading arms as described in the premise.
10. The hypothesis is entailed because standing with arms spread requires the person to be upright to maintain stability and perform the action.
