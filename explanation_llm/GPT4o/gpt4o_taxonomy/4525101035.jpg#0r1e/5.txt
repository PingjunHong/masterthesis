1. The premise describes a young man in a heavy brown winter coat standing in front of a blue railing with his arms spread, which directly supports the hypothesis that the man spreads his arms while standing in front of a railing.
2. The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise, as it describes the same action (spreading arms) and setting (in front of a railing) as mentioned in the premise.
3. The premise provides evidence that the man is standing with his arms spread in front of a railing, which matches the information in the hypothesis, making it an entailment.
4. Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the same individual (a man) performing the same action (arms spread) in the same location (in front of a railing), ensuring that the hypothesis is fully supported by the premise.
5. The action of spreading arms and the location of standing in front of a railing are explicitly stated in the premise, leaving no new or unsupported information in the hypothesis.
6. The presence of the young man, his action of spreading arms, and the setting of the blue railing are all confirmed in the premise, thus entailing the hypothesis as no additional unsupported information is introduced.
