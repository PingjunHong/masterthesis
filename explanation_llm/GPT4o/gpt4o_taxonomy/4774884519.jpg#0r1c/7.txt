An escalator is a moving staircase, while an elevator is a platform or enclosed cabin that moves vertically.
Escalators continuously move up or down, whereas elevators are operated by controls to stop at different floors.
Escalators are typically open and visible, while elevators are enclosed spaces.
People stand on escalators and move with the steps, while elevators require manual operation to go up or down.
Escalators are usually used for short distances, while elevators are designed for vertical transportation over multiple floors.
Escalators can handle a continuous flow of people, whereas elevators have limited capacity and require waiting for availability.
