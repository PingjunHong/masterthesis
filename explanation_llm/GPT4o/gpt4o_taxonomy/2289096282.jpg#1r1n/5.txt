1. The premise does not specify the age of the person in the wagon, so it is not mentioned whether the person is a child or an adult.
2. The hypothesis assumes that the person in the wagon is a child, but the premise does not provide any information to confirm the age of the person.
3. There is no information in the premise about the personâ€™s age, leaving open the possibility that the person could be an adult.
4. The premise mentions a person rolling down a hill but does not specify whether this person is a child, so the hypothesis introduces unsupported information by assuming the person's age.
5. The premise describes a scene involving a person and a wagon, but it does not mention any details about the age or identity of the person, leaving the hypothesis unverified.
6. The hypothesis includes the detail that the person is a child, but this detail is absent from the premise, making it neutral due to lack of supporting evidence.
7. Since the premise does not mention the age of the person in the wagon, the hypothesis remains neutral as it introduces additional, unsupported information about the person's age.
8. The premise does not contain any age-related identifiers for the person in the wagon, rendering the hypothesis about a child unsupported and thus neutral.
