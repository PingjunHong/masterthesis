1. The statement rephrases the premise by specifying "child" instead of "person," which does not confirm the age of the person rolling down the hill.
2. The premise mentions "a person rolls down a hill riding a wagon," whereas the statement specifies "a child in a wagon," which introduces an assumption not supported by the premise.
3. The premise includes "as another watches," which is omitted in the statement, altering the context.
4. The statement rephrases the action to "rolls down a hill," but does not convey the presence of another person watching, as mentioned in the premise.
5. The premise uses "a person" generically, whereas the statement specifies "a child," leading to potential differences in interpretation based on age.
6. The structural rephrasing in the statement omits the interaction implied by "as another watches," which affects the overall meaning compared to the premise.
7. The premise describes a scenario involving two people, one rolling and one watching, while the statement focuses solely on the rolling action, creating syntactic divergence.
8. The statement assumes the person in the wagon is a child, which is not explicitly supported by the premise.
