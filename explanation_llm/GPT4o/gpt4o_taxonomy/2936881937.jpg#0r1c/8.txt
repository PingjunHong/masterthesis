1. The man is inside the garage, which contradicts the statement that he is waiting outside.
2. The presence of tools and the described activity indicate the man is engaged in maintenance work, not waiting.
3. A maintenance garage is typically an indoor space, making it unlikely for someone to be outside while looking at a bicycle's rear wheel.
4. The description implies the man is actively involved in a task inside the garage, not passively waiting outside.
5. Real-world understanding suggests that observing a bicycle's rear wheel requires proximity and presence inside the garage, contradicting the notion of waiting outside.
6. The context of maintenance tools in the background suggests ongoing work, indicating the man is inside, not outside.
7. Casual reasoning about typical garage activities suggests that someone looking over a bicycle wheel would be inside, actively engaged, not outside waiting.
8. The assumption that the man is inside is reinforced by the detailed description of tools and maintenance activities, negating the possibility of him being outside.
9. The logical conclusion based on the premise is that the man is involved in maintenance tasks, which are performed inside a garage, not outside.
