1. The woman in a scarf walking by them is not explicitly mentioned as the one who is judging them, so the reference to "a woman" judging them is ambiguous.
2. The use of "a woman" in the hypothesis could refer to any woman, not necessarily the woman in a scarf, making the judgment aspect uncertain.
3. The description of "a woman in a scarf" does not contain any indications of judgment, so the reference to judgment is not resolved.
4. The premise does not specify any emotions or actions such as judging, making the reference to judgment in the hypothesis unresolved.
5. The statement "a woman walks by and judges them" could refer to either an unspecified woman or the woman in a scarf, leaving the coreference unresolved.
6. The action of 'judging' is not attributed to the woman in the scarf in the premise, leading to a coreference ambiguity regarding who judges.
7. The premise only states a woman in a scarf walks by, without any indication of her reaction or judgment, leaving "judges them" without a resolved referent.
8. The hypothesis introduces an additional action (judging) that is not present in the premise, creating an unresolved reference regarding who performs this action.
9. The reference to "a woman" in the hypothesis does not clearly link to the woman in a scarf, making it unclear if she is the one judging.
