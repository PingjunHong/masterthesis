1. A woman walking by doesnâ€™t necessarily mean she is judging the man and woman taking selfies.
2. The act of taking a picture of themselves doesn't inherently imply the presence of judgment from passersby.
3. Simply observing someone taking selfies doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the observer is judging them.
4. The presence of a woman in a scarf walking by doesn't automatically suggest she has any specific opinion about the selfie-taking.
5. People walking by others taking photos might be focused on their own activities and not necessarily making judgments.
6. The hypothesis assumes emotional or subjective states (judgment) that are not evident from the simple action of walking by.
7. There is no explicit indication in the premise that the woman in the scarf is reacting to or has any thoughts about the selfie-takers.
8. Judgment is an internal state that cannot be inferred solely from the observation of someone walking past others.
9. The scenario described lacks sufficient context or cues to ascertain the thoughts or feelings of the woman in the scarf.
