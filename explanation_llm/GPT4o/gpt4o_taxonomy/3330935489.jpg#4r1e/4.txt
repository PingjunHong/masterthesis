1. If a dog is described as pulling a large stick, it logically follows that the dog is pulling a stick because a large stick is a type of stick.
2. The action of pulling a stick is explicitly mentioned in the premise, so it directly supports the hypothesis that the dog is pulling a stick.
3. The adjective "large" in "large stick" does not negate the fact that the object being pulled is a stick, thus confirming the hypothesis.
4. By removing the modifier "large," the core action and object, that is, pulling a stick, remain consistent between the premise and the hypothesis.
5. The premise explicitly states that the dog is involved in the action of pulling a stick, ensuring the hypothesis is logically entailed.
6. The semantics of the word "stick" in both the premise and hypothesis are identical, confirming that the larger descriptor does not alter the object being referenced.
7. The premise provides a specific instance of a general action described in the hypothesis, ensuring its entailment.
8. The specific detail of the stick being "large" does not alter the fundamental truth that the dog is pulling a stick.
