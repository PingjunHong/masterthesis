1. Sitting on a bench implies that the people are stationary, not running.
2. The premise describes people sitting and looking, which contradicts the action of running.
3. The actions described (sitting, looking, twiddling hair) are incompatible with the action of running.
4. The setting of a station with people sitting indicates a static environment, contradicting the dynamic nature of running.
5. If three people are sitting on a bench, they are not in motion, thus contradicting the idea of running.
6. Looking oddly and twiddling hair are actions that occur while stationary, not while running.
7. The description of individual activities (sitting, looking, twiddling) suggests separate actions, not a collective running action.
8. Awkward positioning while sitting implies a lack of movement, which contradicts running.
9. The scene described is passive and observational, not active and kinetic as running would be.
10. Sitting at a station typically implies waiting, a state opposed to the active movement of running.
