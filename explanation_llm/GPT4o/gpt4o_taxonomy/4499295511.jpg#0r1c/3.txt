1. People run together is a structural rephrasing where running implies movement, which contradicts the premise describing people sitting still on a bench.
2. The action of sitting at the station as described in the premise syntactically contrasts with running together as stated in the hypothesis.
3. The premise details a stationary scene with sitting, while the hypothesis rephrases this as a dynamic action of running, creating a contradiction.
4. Syntactic alternation between sitting and running results in a contradiction since the actions are mutually exclusive in the given context.
5. Coordination of actions in the premise (sitting, looking, twiddling) contradicts the hypothesis's implication of coordinated running.
6. Subordination of actions in the premise (sitting and observing) contradicts the active movement suggested by running in the hypothesis.
7. The structural rephrasing of sitting to running is contradictory because the premise's actions are static and the hypothesis suggests activity.
