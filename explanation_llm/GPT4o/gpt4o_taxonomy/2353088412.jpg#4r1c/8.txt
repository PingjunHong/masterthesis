1. Cats typically do not chase dogs; real-world behavior suggests that dogs are more likely to chase cats or other dogs.
2. The premise specifies another dog doing the chasing, not a cat; the statement contradicts the identified pursuer in the premise.
3. Dogs and cats exhibit different behaviors and interactions; the situation described does not align with typical dog-cat dynamics.
4. Probability suggests that in a dog chase scenario, another dog is more likely to be involved than a cat.
5. The common knowledge about dog and cat interactions does not support the idea that a cat is chasing a dog in this context.
6. Given the typical behavior of animals, a dog being chased by another dog is more plausible than being chased by a cat.
7. The premise establishes that dogs are involved in the chase, contradicting the hypothesis that introduces a cat.
8. Without explicit mention of a cat, assumed information implies the chase involves only dogs, making the statement incorrect.
9. Real-world experience informs us that dogs chasing each other is a common occurrence, whereas dogs being chased by cats is not.
10. The likelihood of a cat chasing a dog in this playful scenario is not supported by typical pet behavior, contradicting the statement.
