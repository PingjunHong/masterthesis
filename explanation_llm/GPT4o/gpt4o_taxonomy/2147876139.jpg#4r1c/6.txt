1. The location of the Peeps is inconsistent; they are on the cake, not in the garden.
2. The presence of Peeps is exclusive to the cake, not the garden.
3. The statement implies Peeps are found in the garden, conflicting with their described location on the cake.
4. The structure suggests a single location for the Peeps, which is contradicted by the claim of them being in the garden.
5. The statement assumes Peeps are elsewhere when they are explicitly stated to be part of the cake.
6. The spatial allocation of Peeps exclusively to the cake contradicts their assumed presence in the garden.
7. The premise specifies the context of the Peeps, which does not include the garden.
8. The logical exclusivity of Peeps belonging on the cake conflicts with their presumed location in the garden.
