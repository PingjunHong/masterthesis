1. The premise mentions that the women are taking a walk down an icy road, but it does not specifically state that they are walking on the ice itself.
2. The road may be covered with ice, but the women could be walking on a cleared path or using a sidewalk next to the road.
3. The presence of ice on the road does not necessarily mean that the women are stepping directly on it; they might be walking on parts of the road that are ice-free.
4. There is no direct evidence in the premise to confirm that the women are in contact with the ice, merely that they are on a road described as icy.
5. The premise does not specify the condition of the road surface where the women are walking, so the hypothesis assumes additional information not provided.
6. The premise lacks details about the specific walking conditions, such as whether the icy road has patches of exposed pavement or is completely covered in ice.
7. The hypothesis suggests a specific interaction with the ice that is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
8. The women might be avoiding the ice by walking on the edge of the road or using alternative footwear for traction, neither of which is mentioned in the premise.
9. The description of the road as icy does not inherently entail that the women's path involves direct contact with the ice.
