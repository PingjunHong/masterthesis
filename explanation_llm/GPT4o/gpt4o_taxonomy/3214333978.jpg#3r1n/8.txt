1. Roads can become icy due to cold weather, meaning the surface they are walking on is likely ice.
2. Walking down an icy road implies that the surface is covered with ice, so the women are walking on the ice.
3. Icy roads are typically characterized by a layer of ice, which suggests the women are directly walking on the ice.
4. In cold weather conditions, roads can develop a coating of ice, indicating that the women are walking on that ice.
5. The description of the road as 'icy' suggests a layer of ice present on the road, hence the women are walking on ice.
6. When a road is described as icy, it is often assumed that the road is covered in ice, and the women are therefore walking on it.
7. Icy roads imply that the road's surface is slippery and covered with ice, supporting the idea that the women are walking on ice.
8. The term 'icy road' inherently suggests that ice is present on the road surface, affirming that the women are walking on ice.
9. It is common knowledge that icy conditions involve ice forming on surfaces like roads, so the women are walking on ice.
10. An icy road is expected to have ice as part of its surface condition, indicating the women are walking on the ice.
