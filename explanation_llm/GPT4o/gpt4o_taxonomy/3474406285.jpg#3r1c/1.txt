1. The dog in the pool refers to the brown dog that is jumping over an obstacle, which implies the dog is not in a pool.
2. The brown dog mentioned in the premise cannot be the same dog in the pool since it is actively jumping over an obstacle.
3. The reference to "the dog" in the pool is contradictory because the brown dog is described as jumping, not swimming.
4. Resolving the reference of "the dog" shows a contradiction as the brown dog is engaged in jumping over an obstacle, not being in a pool.
5. The statement "the dog is in a pool" conflicts with "a brown dog jumps over an obstacle," indicating they cannot refer to the same situation or dog.
6. The dog in the premise is accounted for by its action of jumping, contradicting the pool location in the hypothesis.
7. The contradiction arises because the dog referenced in both statements is situated in different locations, jumping over an obstacle versus being in a pool.
8. The reference to "the dog" cannot be consistent across the premise and statement since the actions and locations described are mutually exclusive.
