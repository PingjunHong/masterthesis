1. Jumping over an obstacle implies the dog is on dry ground, not in a pool.
2. Being in a pool contradicts the action of jumping over an obstacle, as jumping requires solid ground.
3. The act of jumping suggests the presence of gravity and a surface to push off from, which is inconsistent with being in a pool.
4. An obstacle typically exists outside of a pool, indicating that the dog is not in a pool.
5. The description of jumping over suggests a horizontal movement incompatible with the vertical constraints of a pool.
6. Being in water would impede the dog's ability to jump over an obstacle.
7. The spatial context of jumping over implies an open area, unlike the enclosed space of a pool.
8. The term "jumps over" indicates the dog is airborne, which is not feasible in a pool filled with water.
9. Jumping over an obstacle requires a dry surface for traction, contradicting the wet environment of a pool.
10. The phrase "jumps over" denotes a dynamic action that is not typically associated with the static environment of being in a pool.
