1. "People" in both the premise and the hypothesis refer to the same group of individuals engaging in the activity.
2. "A mountain crevasse" in both the premise and hypothesis refers to the same physical location or feature.
3. "Jump over" in the premise is in contradiction with "slide over" in the hypothesis, as these actions are mutually exclusive.
4. "On a rope" in the premise refers to the method used by the people, which is different from "on a slide" in the hypothesis.
5. The action described in the premise and hypothesis involves the same crevasse, but the methods—jumping versus sliding—are different, leading to a contradiction.
6. The reference to the method of crossing the crevasse in the premise ("on a rope") contradicts the method described in the hypothesis ("on a slide").
