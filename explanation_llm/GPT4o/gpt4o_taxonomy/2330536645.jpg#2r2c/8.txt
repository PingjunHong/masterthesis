1. Playing in the water and playing mini golf are mutually exclusive activities, as playing mini golf requires being on a dry surface with specific equipment not used in water.
2. Mini golf is typically played on a structured course, not in a water setting where children are currently playing.
3. The nature of mini golf involves clubs and balls, whereas playing in water does not involve these items, making the activities fundamentally different.
4. Water play often involves splashing and swimming, activities incompatible with the precision and equipment needed for mini golf.
5. Probability of playing mini golf in water is extremely low given the lack of necessary infrastructure or equipment for mini golf in a water environment.
6. Real-world setup for mini golf courses is on land with artificial turf, which cannot exist in water where the children are playing.
7. Playing in water does not align with the rules and requirements of mini golf, which involve putting a ball into holes over a dry course.
8. Assumption that children playing in water could simultaneously be playing mini golf defies the common understanding of how each activity is uniquely conducted.
9. Water play is characterized by freeform movement and play, unlike the structured, goal-oriented nature of mini golf.
10. Mini golf courses are designed with obstacles and pathways, which cannot be replicated or utilized effectively in a water setting.
