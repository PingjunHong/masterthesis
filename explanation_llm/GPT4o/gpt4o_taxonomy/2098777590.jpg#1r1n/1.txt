1. The person referred to in the statement could be the elderly woman in the premise, but this is not definitively established.
2. The phrase "preparing food" in the premise is not necessarily equivalent to "makes dinner" in the statement, as the activity could involve preparing a meal for a different time or purpose.
3. "A person" in the statement does not specifically identify the elderly woman in the premise, leaving room for multiple interpretations.
4. The term "dinner" in the statement does not directly match the unspecified food preparation in the premise, creating ambiguity in the reference.
5. There is no explicit indication that the elderly woman's preparation in the kitchen is related to making dinner, thus leaving the statement neutral.
6. The statement uses "a person," which is a more general reference and does not confirm that it is the elderly woman from the premise.
7. The premise does not specify that the food preparation is for a dinner meal, leaving the statement's reference unresolved.
8. The premise describes an activity without a specified outcome or meal, so the statement's reference to "makes dinner" remains unconfirmed.
9. Since the premise does not limit the action to dinner preparation, the statement's reference is not specifically resolved.
