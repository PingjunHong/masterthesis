3. The act of preparing food in the kitchen does not logically entail that the food being prepared is dinner, as it could be lunch, breakfast, or a non-specific meal.
4. The premise does not state the time of day, so preparing food could be for any meal, not specifically dinner.
5. The statement "makes dinner" implies completion of a meal, whereas "preparing food" in the premise does not indicate the meal is finished or served.
6. The premise focuses on the act of preparation, while the statement assumes a specific outcome (dinner), which is not logically confirmed by the premise.
7. The premise does not mention the intention or purpose behind preparing food, whereas the statement assumes the purpose is making dinner.
