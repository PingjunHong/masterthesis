1. The man is running after a robber implies the man is pursuing someone, which contradicts the description of him flinging himself over a pole.
2. Running after a robber suggests movement directed at chasing another person, conflicting with the action of flinging oneself over a pole, which indicates a different activity.
3. The act of running after a robber is inconsistent with flinging oneself over a pole, as the former suggests pursuit on foot and the latter suggests a jumping or leaping action.
4. Pursuing a robber entails a forward, directed motion, whereas flinging oneself over a pole involves an upward or acrobatic motion, leading to a contradiction.
5. Running implies a continuous motion on the ground, which contradicts the act of flinging over a pole, an airborne action.
