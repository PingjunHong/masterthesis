1. A woman cannot be working long hours and sleeping at the same time because these are mutually exclusive activities.
2. If a woman is working long hours, she is actively engaged in tasks or duties, which contradicts the state of being asleep.
3. Sleeping requires a state of rest or inactivity, which is directly opposed to the active state of working long hours.
4. The concept of working long hours suggests that the woman is awake, alert, and engaged, which is incompatible with being asleep.
5. Real-world understanding implies that one cannot perform work tasks while being unconscious or asleep.
6. Generally, working long hours implies a prolonged period of activity, whereas sleeping implies a period of inactivity, making both scenarios contradictory.
7. The physical and mental state required for effective work is incompatible with the unconscious state required for sleep.
8. Causally, if a woman is described as working long hours, it implies she is not in a condition to sleep at that specific time.
9. Probabilistically, it is highly unlikely for someone to be described as both sleeping and working long hours simultaneously, as the two are opposing states.
10. Assuming real-world conditions, being actively involved in work negates the possibility of being in a state of sleep.
