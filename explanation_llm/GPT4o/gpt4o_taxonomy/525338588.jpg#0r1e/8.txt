1. Since the people are described as standing outside the building, it logically follows that they are not inside the building.
2. Being outside implies a location that is not within the interior space of the building, thus confirming they aren't inside.
3. The act of standing outside inherently means they are not located inside the building at the same time.
4. The spatial relationship indicated by "outside" versus "inside" is mutually exclusive, confirming the statement.
5. The description of people standing outside suggests that their current position is external to the building's interior.
6. A sign reading 'HI-POINTE' is associated with the building's exterior, reinforcing that the group is not inside.
7. Real-world understanding of "outside" versus "inside" supports the conclusion that the group isn't inside the building.
8. In typical scenarios, if individuals are outside, they are not occupying the interior space, supporting the entailment.
9. The term "outside" denotes a location external to the building, making it impossible for them to simultaneously be inside.
10. Given the context, the presence of the sign and people outside aligns with the interpretation that they are not inside.
11. Common knowledge dictates that being outside separates the group spatially from the interior, confirming they aren't inside.
12. Observing a sign from outside implies visibility from an external position, consistent with not being inside the building.
