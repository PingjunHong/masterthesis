1. The location conflict arises because the premise specifies people are outside, so they cannot be inside the building.
2. The use of "outside" in the premise implies structural logical exclusivity, making it impossible for the people to be inside simultaneously.
3. The spatial relationship described in the premise excludes the possibility of the group being inside the building.
4. The term "outside" in the premise logically conflicts with the notion of being "inside," supporting the entailment.
5. The premise establishes a structural logic of location that precludes the group from being inside the building.
6. Quantifier conflict emerges as "many people" outside suggests no individuals are inside.
7. Structural exclusivity of being "outside" versus "inside" ensures the entailment is true.
8. The word "outside" in the premise creates a location conflict that verifies the group is not inside.
9. The premise's emphasis on the exterior location of the people ensures they are not inside the building.
10. The logical structure of "outside" and "in front of" confirms the group's external position relative to the building.
