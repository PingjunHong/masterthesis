1. The premise doesn't specify the time of day, so the assumption that it is daytime is not guaranteed.
2. Dogs can run through fields at any time, including nighttime, so the hypothesis about daytime is not necessarily true.
3. There is no indication in the premise that light conditions are mentioned, leaving the time of day ambiguous.
4. The observation of dogs running in a field doesn't provide information about the time of day or lighting conditions.
5. The premise lacks details about the environment's lighting, which means the running could be happening at any hour.
6. While it's common for dogs to run during the day, they can also run at dawn, dusk, or under artificial lighting at night.
7. The description in the premise does not include any time markers, so the assumption of daytime remains speculative.
8. Without explicit time-related cues in the premise, inferring daytime is an unstated assumption.
