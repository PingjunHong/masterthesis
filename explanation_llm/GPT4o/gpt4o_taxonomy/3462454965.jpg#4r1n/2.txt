1. "Through a field" does not specify the time of day, so it could be either daytime or nighttime.
2. The word "field" does not imply any particular time of day.
3. The premise does not mention any details about the time, so the time of day is unknown.
4. "Running through a field" describes an action but says nothing about when it occurs.
5. The statement "running in the daytime" adds information not provided in the premise.
6. "Daytime" is a time-specific word not present in the premise, making the hypothesis an assumption.
7. The term "daytime" in the hypothesis is not explicitly matched by any term in the premise.
8. The activity of dogs running does not inherently imply a specific time of day.
