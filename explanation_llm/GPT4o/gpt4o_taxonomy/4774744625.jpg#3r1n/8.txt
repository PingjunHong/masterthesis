- The premise lacks any audible or visual cues that would suggest conversation, such as gestures or speech.
- The fact that they are sitting might imply rest or relaxation, but does not establish communication.
- The presence of chairs indicates a seating arrangement but does not specify the nature of interaction between the men.
