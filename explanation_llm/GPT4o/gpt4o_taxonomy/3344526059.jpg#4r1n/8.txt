1. The presence of a hockey player in a helmet does not imply that all players are wearing helmets, as the premise only describes one player.
2. The fact that one hockey player is wearing a helmet does not guarantee that every player in the game is wearing a helmet, as different teams or players might have different equipment requirements.
3. It is possible for a hockey player to wear a helmet while other players choose not to, whether due to personal preference or differing safety regulations.
4. The observation of a single hockey player wearing a helmet does not provide enough information to determine the equipment worn by other players.
5. The premise mentions only one player wearing a helmet, which does not logically necessitate that helmets are worn by all players in the game.
6. While helmets are common in hockey, the statement that players are wearing helmets relies on an assumption that all players follow the same practices, which is not necessarily true.
7. The premise indicates the presence of a helmet on one player, but does not specify if this is a team-wide or league-wide requirement.
8. Just because one hockey player is described with a helmet does not mean that the statement about all players wearing helmets has been substantiated by the premise.
9. The premise does not specify the context of the hockey game or whether helmet-wearing is a standard practice for all players involved.
10. The singular focus on one hockey player in the premise fails to address the attire of other players, leaving the hypothesis about all players wearing helmets unsupported.
