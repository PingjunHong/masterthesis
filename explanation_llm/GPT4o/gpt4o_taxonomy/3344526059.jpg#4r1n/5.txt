- The premise mentions a single hockey player in a helmet, but does not specify that multiple players are wearing helmets.
- The premise only references one individual, leaving the possibility that other players may or may not be wearing helmets unaddressed.
- No information is given about other players, so we can't conclude that more than one player is wearing a helmet.
- The premise lacks any mention of additional players, so the statement about multiple players wearing helmets is unsupported.
- The presence of one helmeted player does not imply that all players, or multiple players, are similarly equipped.
- The hypothesis introduces the notion of multiple players, which is not mentioned or supported by the premise.
- The premise provides evidence for one helmeted player, but it does not affirm or deny the presence of helmets on other players.
- The premise does not address the number of players or their equipment beyond the single mentioned player, leaving the hypothesis unverified.
- The hypothesis assumes a group situation with helmets, but the premise does not provide evidence for anything beyond an individual scenario.
