- Working on an earthen structure with a pickaxe implies being outdoors or in a construction-like environment, which contradicts being in an office building.
- A pickaxe is typically used for activities such as digging or mining, which are inconsistent with office building activities.
- An earthen structure suggests a natural or construction setting, not the artificial environment of an office building.
- The action of working with a pickaxe on an earthen structure suggests manual labor, contradicting the usual indoor and desk-based nature of tasks in an office building.
- The premise's setting involves physical, outdoor labor, which inherently opposes the indoor professional setting implied by an office building.
