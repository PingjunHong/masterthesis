1. Working on an Earthen structure implies being outdoors, whereas being in an office building implies being indoors.
2. The action of using a pickaxe on an Earthen structure suggests an outdoor setting, which contradicts the indoor setting of an office building.
3. The premise involves an Earthen structure and a pickaxe, typically associated with construction or excavation outdoors, unlike an office building setting.
4. The context of working on an Earthen structure does not align with the typical environment of an office building.
5. The structural activity described in the premise (using a pickaxe on Earth) cannot occur inside an office building.
6. The setting implied by working on an Earthen structure contradicts the indoor environment of an office building.
7. The contradiction arises from the juxtaposition of an outdoor activity (pickaxe and Earthen structure) with an indoor location (office building).
8. The premise's outdoor construction scenario opposes the hypothesis's indoor office setting.
9. The use of a pickaxe on Earth suggests an outdoor scenario, which is incompatible with the indoor office building described in the hypothesis.
10. An Earthen structure worked on with a pickaxe indicates an outdoor environment, contrary to the hypothesis of an indoor office building.
