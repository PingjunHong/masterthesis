1. The premise specifies a young boy in green shorts, whereas the statement refers to a clever person, which is not directly inferable from the premise.
2. The premise describes a specific action of balancing on a pipe above a river, while the statement generalizes this to simply balancing, lacking the specific context of the pipe and the river.
3. The premise identifies the individual as a young boy, but the statement does not specify age or gender, focusing instead on the characteristic of being clever.
4. The premise does not provide any information about the boy's cleverness, only his action, so cleverness cannot be inferred.
5. The action of balancing described in the premise is performed by a young boy, and although balancing might imply skill, it does not logically entail cleverness without additional context.
6. The statement's use of the word "person" is broader and more general than the premise's "young boy," which does not logically lead from one to the other.
7. The premise includes specific details about attire and location (green shorts, above a river), which are not addressed in the statement, leading to a lack of direct inference.
8. The premise does not contain any semantic indications of the boy's intelligence or cleverness, which is the focus of the statement.
