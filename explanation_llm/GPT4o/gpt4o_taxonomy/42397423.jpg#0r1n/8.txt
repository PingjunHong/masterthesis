The description of the boy does not specify cleverness, as balancing does not inherently require cleverness.
The act of balancing on a pipe above a river does not imply cleverness, as it could be due to practice or physical skill.
The premise mentions a boy, while the hypothesis refers to a person, indicating a mismatch in specificity regarding cleverness.
Balancing on a pipe does not require cleverness, but might involve physical ability or courage.
Being clever is not a necessary condition for balancing on a pipe; many children can balance without being considered clever.
The situation described involves physical coordination, which does not inherently suggest cleverness.
The boy's actions might be risky but do not necessarily reflect cleverness.
The premise does not provide information about the boy's cognitive abilities or decision-making skills to support cleverness.
Cleverness is a trait related to mental acuity, whereas balancing is a physical skill, creating a disconnect in the inference.
Balancing above a river could be adventurous but doesn't imply cleverness without additional context.
