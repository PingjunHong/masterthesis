1. The term "men" in the premise can be reasonably interpreted as "guys" in the statement, as both refer to adult male humans.
2. "Work along a wall" in the premise implies "working near a wall" in the statement because being "along" suggests proximity and engagement in work.
3. "Men in hard hats" suggests they are likely engaged in construction or maintenance work, which aligns with the general idea of "working" in the statement.
4. Hard hats are commonly used in construction work, reinforcing the understanding that the men are indeed "working" as stated.
5. The presence of a "wall" in both the premise and the statement indicates both are referring to the same or a similar setting.
6. The use of "along" in the premise suggests proximity, which can be interpreted as "near" in the statement given the context of positioning relative to the wall.
7. The context of wearing hard hats strongly indicates a work-related activity, supporting the idea that the men are indeed engaged in "working."
8. The assumption that men in hard hats are working is supported by real-world knowledge that hard hats are typically worn in work environments requiring safety measures.
9. The premise and the statement both describe a scene involving men, a wall, and work, aligning conceptually and contextually to confirm entailment.
10. The presence of hard hats implies a work environment, which, combined with the mention of a wall, leads to the logical conclusion that "guys are working near a wall."
