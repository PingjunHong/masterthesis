1. Cooking with fire typically involves using pots or pans, not ovens, which rely on electricity or gas rather than open flames.
2. The premise specifies pots, which are distinct from ovens as cooking implements.
3. Multiple pots being used simultaneously suggests stovetop cooking, whereas ovens are typically used for baking or roasting, not simultaneous fire cooking.
4. The use of fire implies an open flame, which is not characteristic of ovens.
5. The description of cooking with fire indicates a direct heat source, incompatible with the enclosed heating mechanism of ovens.
6. The concept of "like 5 pots" in the premise contrasts with the idea of "a bunch of ovens," as pots are portable and usually used on a stovetop.
7. Pots refer to containers for cooking on a stove, while ovens are large appliances, indicating a difference in cooking method and equipment.
8. The simultaneous use of multiple pots suggests a scenario incompatible with the typical use of ovens, which usually accommodate one dish per unit.
9. Fire is used directly under pots, whereas ovens use indirect heat contained within a chamber, indicating a contradiction in cooking methods.
10. The premise's focus on using pots directly conflicts with the hypothesis's mention of ovens, illustrating a fundamental difference in cooking technique.
