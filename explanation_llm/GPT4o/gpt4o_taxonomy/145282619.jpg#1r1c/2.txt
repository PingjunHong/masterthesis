1. Ovens and pots are different cooking appliances, and the premise specifies pots, not ovens.
2. Cooking with fire in pots does not imply the use of ovens, which typically rely on electricity or gas.
3. Pots are used on stovetops, while ovens are enclosed appliances, indicating a contradiction in cooking methods.
4. The premise describes cooking with fire, which is incompatible with the use of multiple ovens, as ovens do not cook with open flames.
5. The term "pots" in the premise refers to a type of cookware distinct from "ovens" mentioned in the hypothesis, creating a mismatch in cooking tools.
6. "At the same time" implies simultaneous use of pots, typically not feasible with ovens, as each requires individual attention or settings.
7. The semantic difference between "pots" and "ovens" highlights a contradiction, as they are not interchangeable terms.
8. The action of cooking with fire in pots does not semantically align with the action of using ovens, which operate differently.
