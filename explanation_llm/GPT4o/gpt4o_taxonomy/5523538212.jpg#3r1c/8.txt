1. Ski-jumping is performed on a ramp or hill, whereas skiing down the road implies a flat surface, making both activities mutually exclusive in the same context.
2. Ski-jumping typically occurs in designated areas with specific slopes, while skiing down a road generally implies movement on a relatively flat, paved surface, which contradicts the setting of ski-jumping.
3. The premise describes a ski-jumping event with spectators, which is incompatible with skiing down a road, as ski-jumping requires a hill or ramp.
4. Ski-jumping involves aerial maneuvers and high-speed descents, contrasting with downhill skiing on a road, which requires a different terrain.
5. The context of "ski-jumping" suggests extreme sports typically done on snow-covered hills, whereas "skiing down the road" suggests a casual activity on a transport route, which does not fit the premise.
6. Observing ski-jumping implies a specific location with a jump, while skiing down a road implies a different geographic setting, making the actions contradictory.
7. Roads are typically not suitable for ski-jumping, which requires specialized slopes, thus indicating a contradiction in the locations described.
8. Ski-jumping is an event usually held on prepared jumps or slopes for winter sports, while skiing down a road indicates a different, non-sporting activity.
9. The presence of spectators watching ski-jumping indicates a sports event, whereas skiing down a road implies personal travel, which contradicts the competitive nature of the premise.
10. Ski-jumping involves equipment and preparation distinct from skiing down a road, thus creating a contradiction in the type of skiing described.
