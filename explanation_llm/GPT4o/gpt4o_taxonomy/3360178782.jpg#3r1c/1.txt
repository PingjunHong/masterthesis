1. The term "people" in the premise refers to humans, whereas "dogs" in the hypothesis refers to animals, creating a contradiction between the two groups mentioned.
2. The group mentioned in the premise as "people" cannot be the same group referred to as "dogs" in the hypothesis, as they are different entities.
3. The reference to "a group" in both the premise and hypothesis does not resolve to the same type of beings, as "people" are explicitly human and "dogs" are explicitly canine.
4. The coreference of "a group" in the premise is linked to "people," which cannot be reconciled with the coreference of "a group" in the hypothesis linked to "dogs."
5. In resolving the references, "a group of people" from the premise cannot be equated to "a group of dogs" from the hypothesis due to the fundamental difference between humans and dogs.
