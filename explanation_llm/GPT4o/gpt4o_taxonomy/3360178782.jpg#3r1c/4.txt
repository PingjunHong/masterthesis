1. The premise specifies that the observers are people, while the hypothesis specifies that the observers are dogs, which creates a direct contradiction in the identity of the observers.
2. The semantic meaning of "people" inherently excludes "dogs," as they represent entirely different categories of beings.
3. The logical structure of the premise asserts human observation, whereas the hypothesis incorrectly asserts canine observation, contradicting the premise's specified group.
4. The premise logically implies human participation at the market, while the hypothesis suggests an impossibility by replacing humans with dogs, contradicting the premise.
5. In the semantic structure of the premise, "people" are the subject of the action; the hypothesis changes the subject to "dogs," directly contradicting the premise.
6. The underlying implication that the premise involves human activity at a market is contradicted by the hypothesis stating dog involvement, as dogs do not engage in such activities in the same manner as humans.
7. The premise establishes a scenario involving human presence, while the hypothesis disrupts this scenario with an illogical substitution of species, thus contradicting the premise.
8. The semantic role of "people" in the premise is misrepresented in the hypothesis by substituting "dogs," leading to a contradiction in the identity and function of the observers.
