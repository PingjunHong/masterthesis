1. The phrase "A group of people" cannot be rephrased as "A group of dogs" as they refer to different entities.
2. "People" and "dogs" are distinct categories, so substituting one for the other changes the meaning entirely.
3. The structure "A group of people look at fresh lettuce" is syntactically similar to "A group of dogs look at fresh lettuce," but the substitution of "people" with "dogs" creates a contradiction in meaning.
4. "People" and "dogs" are not synonymous, thus the rephrasing changes the subject and contradicts the original premise.
5. The semantic roles are altered when "people" is replaced by "dogs," leading to a contradiction rather than an equivalent rephrasing.
6. The rephrased subject "dogs" in the hypothesis does not match the subject "people" in the premise, creating a contradiction.
7. The sentence structure remains the same, but "people" and "dogs" are mutually exclusive terms, resulting in a contradiction.
8. Replacing "people" with "dogs" changes the agent involved in the action, contradicting the premise's meaning.
9. Both sentences describe a group looking at lettuce, but differing subjects ("people" vs. "dogs") lead to a contradiction despite structural similarity.
10. The hypothesis maintains the same syntactic structure but introduces a contradiction by substituting "people" with "dogs."
