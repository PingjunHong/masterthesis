1. The premise describes a building painted white and blue with specific words, while the hypothesis refers to it as a school, which is not directly indicated by the premise.
2. The hypothesis introduces the concept of a school, which is not explicitly mentioned or inferred from the building described in the premise.
3. The structural rephrasing involves the term "school," which is not interchangeable with "a building painted white and blue with the words ING and PEOPLE."
4. The premise provides specific details about the building that do not confirm it is a school, making the hypothesis a possible but unverified interpretation.
5. The hypothesis uses a more general term "school" in place of the specific description given in the premise, which does not directly support this categorization.
6. The syntactic structure of the premise focuses on the physical description of the building, while the hypothesis shifts to a presumed function or identity (school) not directly supported by the premise.
7. The hypothesis assumes a particular use of the building (as a school) without the premise providing evidence for such a function.
8. The premise uses descriptive language related to appearance, and the hypothesis makes an assumption about the building's purpose, which is not a direct rephrasing.
