1. Ducks typically do not sleep while expanding their wings as they require a stable position to rest.
2. Expanding wings is an action associated with movement or drying off, not sleeping.
3. Sleeping ducks usually tuck their heads under their wings, which is inconsistent with expanding wings.
4. Floating and expanding wings suggest active behavior, not resting or sleeping.
5. To sleep soundly, ducks often find a secure, stable place, which is not compatible with the action of expanding wings.
6. The act of expanding wings would likely disturb the duck's balance, making it difficult to sleep soundly.
7. When ducks sleep on water, they typically maintain a low-energy posture without expanding their wings.
8. The duck is actively engaging its muscles to expand its wings, contrary to the relaxed state required for sound sleep.
9. Ducks are more vulnerable when they sleep, which is why they minimize movement like wing expansion.
10. Expanding wings suggests alertness or activity, both of which contradict the state of being asleep.
