- "His wife" refers to a woman in a black jacket and a black and white striped skirt, but the premise describes her as watching another woman, not as being looked at by a father.
- "His wife" would need to refer to the woman talking, but the premise specifies that the woman talking is not being watched by a father.
- "Son" must refer to the little boy sitting on concrete steps, but the premise does not describe this boy as being the son of any father present.
- The premise describes women and a little boy, but does not mention a father or any man, contradicting the reference to "father" in the statement.
- The statement implies a familial relationship with a father, wife, and son, none of whom are identified or implied in the premise.
- The premise makes no mention of a "father," thus contradicting the presence of "a father" in the statement.
- The premise describes interaction between a woman and a little boy without indicating any familial relationships involving a father.
- The contradiction arises because the premise does not resolve "his wife" and "son" to any individuals described in the premise; no father is watching them.
- The premise presents a scenario with two women and a boy, but no father is involved, negating the references to familial roles in the statement.
- "Father" in the statement cannot be resolved to any participant in the premise, leading to a contradiction since no male figure is mentioned or implied.
