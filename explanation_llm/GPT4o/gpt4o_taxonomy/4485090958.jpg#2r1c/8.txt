1. The premise does not mention a father, which contradicts the statement that a father is present.
2. The premise describes two women and a little boy, not a man, contradicting the suggestion of a father looking at his wife and son.
3. The premise does not include any indication that the woman speaking to the boy is his mother, contradicting the notion of a father looking at his wife.
