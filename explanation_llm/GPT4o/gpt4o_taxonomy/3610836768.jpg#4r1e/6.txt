1. The premise specifies "villagers," which implies people; thus, the statement that "there are people pulling a boat" is logically entailed.
2. "Pulling in the fish boat" indicates the action of pulling a boat, confirming the statement that there are people pulling a boat.
3. The term "villagers" describes a subset of "people," so if villagers are involved, people are necessarily involved.
4. The premise involves pulling a boat, which aligns with the statement about people pulling a boat, indicating structural consistency.
5. The action of pulling mentioned in the premise directly corresponds to the action described in the statement, affirming entailment.
6. The premise's context of a boat being pulled confirms the presence of people involved in pulling, supporting the statement.
7. The exclusivity of the task of pulling a boat logically necessitates people to perform it, which matches the statement.
8. If "villagers" are pulling, this necessarily involves "people," as villagers are a type of people, thus entailing the statement.
9. The action "pulling in" necessitates a subject, which is inherently people, consistent with the statementâ€™s claim.
10. The logical structure of needing people to pull a boat is satisfied in both the premise and the statement.
