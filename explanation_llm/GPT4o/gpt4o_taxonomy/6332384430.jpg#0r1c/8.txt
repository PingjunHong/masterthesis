1. The color of the belts worn by the men (red and blue) contradicts the statement that they are blackbelts, as black belts are specifically designated by wearing a black belt in martial arts.
2. In martial arts, being a blackbelt is a specific rank that is visually represented by wearing a black belt, and neither man is wearing a black belt in the picture.
3. The men are wearing belts of colors other than black, which indicates they are not at the blackbelt level in martial arts.
4. The visual evidence provided by the picture shows belts of colors that do not correspond to the blackbelt rank, directly contradicting the statement.
5. The premise depicts the men with belts that are red and blue, whereas blackbelts must wear black belts, making the statement false.
6. Martial arts ranking systems use the color of the belt to denote rank, and since neither man is wearing a black belt, the statement that they are blackbelts is incorrect.
7. The presence of colored belts other than black in the image suggests that the men have not achieved the blackbelt rank, making the statement a contradiction.
8. According to martial arts tradition, only those who have achieved the blackbelt rank wear black belts, while the men in the image are wearing belts of other colors.
9. The picture shows the men with red and blue belts, which signifies ranks below the blackbelt rank, thus contradicting the claim in the statement.
10. The belt colors shown in the image (red and blue) do not correspond to the blackbelt rank, contradicting the statement that the men are blackbelts.
