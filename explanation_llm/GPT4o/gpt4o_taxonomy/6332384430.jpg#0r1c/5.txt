- The premise mentions the colors of the belts worn by the men, but does not indicate their level of expertise or rank in martial arts, so we can't assume they are blackbelts.
- The color of the belts worn by the men, red and blue, does not imply they are blackbelts based on the premise.
- The premise provides no information on the martial arts proficiency or ranking of the men practicing, so their rank cannot be assumed as blackbelt.
- The premise describes the scene without mentioning the martial arts ranking system or qualification of the individuals, leaving their expertise unverified.
- The premise does not mention or provide evidence of the men's martial arts achievements or certifications, so their status as blackbelts is unsupported.
- The specific colors of belts mentioned in the premise (red and blue) are not associated with the rank of blackbelt in martial arts, contradicting the hypothesis.
- The premise lacks any detail about the men's martial arts background or skill level, making the statement about them being blackbelts unsubstantiated.
