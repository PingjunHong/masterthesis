1. The premise describes the men as wearing colored belts, specifically a red belt and a blue belt, which indicates their martial arts rank is not blackbelt.
2. In martial arts, a blackbelt signifies a specific level of expertise, which is contradicted by the specified colors of the belts worn by the men.
3. The premise explicitly mentions belt colors that are not black, directly contradicting the statement that the men are blackbelts.
4. The men are described by the belt colors they are wearing, red and blue, which means they cannot simultaneously be wearing black belts as the statement suggests.
5. The men's belts are identified by colors other than black, which inherently contradicts them being blackbelts.
