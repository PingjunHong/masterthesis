1. The premise explicitly states that there are two little boys who are smiling and laughing, which directly supports the hypothesis that there are two little boys smiling, with no additional assumptions needed.
2. The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is unsupported by the premise; it simply restates the fact that the boys are smiling, which is mentioned in the premise.
3. The fact that the boys are smiling is directly observed in the premise, meaning the hypothesis is fully supported by the available evidence.
4. The premise includes both boys smiling and laughing, providing ample support for the claim that there are two little boys smiling.
5. Since the premise describes the boys as smiling, the hypothesis, which focuses only on the smiling aspect, is logically entailed by the information given.
6. The hypothesis makes no claims beyond what is explicitly observed in the premise, which mentions the boys smiling.
7. The premise encompasses the scenario described in the hypothesis, with no missing or additional information that would prevent entailment.
8. Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the observed action of smiling by the two boys, establishing a clear entailment.
9. The hypothesis is a straightforward simplification of the premise's description, with no divergence or additional claims beyond what is already stated.
