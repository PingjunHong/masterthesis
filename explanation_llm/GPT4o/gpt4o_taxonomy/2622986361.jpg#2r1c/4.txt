1. The premise describes people on the edge of a roof, implying they are not in the process of climbing down.
2. The statement involves climbing down a ladder, which contradicts the description of being on the roof's edge.
3. Being on the edge of a roof suggests a stationary position, not the action of descending.
4. The premise does not include any mention of a ladder, contradicting the statement's assertion.
5. The premise implies a situation of potential risk or observation, not active movement down a building.
6. Climbing down would suggest movement away from the roof, conflicting with the premise's focus on the roof's edge.
7. The presence of a crowd looking up suggests the three people are above them, not descending.
8. The edge of a roof does not logically align with the action of climbing down, which would start from a different position.
