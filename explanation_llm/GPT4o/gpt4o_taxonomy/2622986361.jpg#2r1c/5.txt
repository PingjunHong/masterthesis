1. The premise describes people on the edge of the roof, but there is no mention of a ladder, making the climbing down scenario unsupported.
2. The hypothesis introduces the action of climbing down, which is not mentioned in the premise, indicating a contradictory scenario.
3. The premise does not provide evidence of a ladder, or any climbing activity, implying the hypothesis is introducing unsupported details.
4. The activity described in the hypothesis requires a ladder, which is absent in the premise, resulting in a contradiction.
5. The location of the people is the edge of the roof, not the ladder, suggesting the hypothesis presents unsupported information.
6. The scenario of climbing down is not described or implied in the premise, hence the hypothesis contradicts the given information.
7. The hypothesis suggests a descent, whereas the premise only mentions people on the roof, lacking any climbing context.
8. The presence of a ladder is a crucial element in the hypothesis but is not mentioned in the premise, leading to a contradiction.
9. The action of climbing down requires additional context not provided by the premise, resulting in unsupported information.
10. The hypothesis involves an activity (climbing down) not evident in the premise, indicating a contradiction due to the absence of mention.
