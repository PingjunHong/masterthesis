1. "Three people" in the statement refers to "3 people on the edge of the roof" in the content, but being on the edge does not imply climbing down.
2. "The ladder" in the statement is not mentioned or implied in the content where the people are simply on the edge of the roof.
3. "Climbing down" in the statement contradicts the position of being "on the edge of the roof" described in the content.
4. The crowd looking up at "3 people on the edge of the roof" suggests they are above, not climbing down as stated.
5. "A crowd of people looking up" implies the 3 people are above them, inconsistent with "climbing down the ladder."
6. "3 people on the edge of the roof" refers to a static position, conflicting with the action of "climbing down" in the statement.
7. The statement's "climbing down the ladder" implies movement downward, which does not match the content's description of "on the edge."
8. The phrase "on the edge of the roof" indicates a position, not an activity like "climbing down" as stated.
9. The content focuses on people "on the edge of the roof," but the statement implies they are actively descending, which is a contradiction.
10. "The building" in both content and statement refers to the same structure, but the actions described do not align.
