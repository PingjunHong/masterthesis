1. People on the edge of a roof and people climbing a ladder are mutually exclusive situations, as one cannot be on the edge and simultaneously climbing down.
2. Being on the edge of a roof suggests that the individuals have not yet started to descend, contradicting the idea that they are already climbing down a ladder.
3. A crowd looking up implies the individuals are still on the roof, not descending via a ladder, which would cause the crowd to look elsewhere.
4. Climbing down a ladder requires the individuals to be in the process of descending, not standing on the roof's edge.
5. The position on the roof's edge suggests preparation for descent but not the act of climbing down, which involves a different location and action.
6. Standing on the edge of a roof involves being stationary or preparing for an action, whereas climbing down is an active movement away from the edge.
7. The act of being on the edge of the roof is inconsistent with the act of descending, which would require them to be away from the edge and engaged with a ladder.
8. If the three people were climbing down a ladder, the crowd would likely be looking in the direction of the ladder rather than up at the roof.
9. The physical position described (on the edge of a roof) contradicts the action described (climbing down a ladder).
10. The real-world expectation that individuals climb down from a roof using a ladder implies they cannot be simultaneously on the roof's edge.
