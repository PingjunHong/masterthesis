- Playground equipment can include various structures such as slides, monkey bars, and merry-go-rounds, not exclusively swings.
- The premise does not specify the time of day, so "after school" cannot be inferred.
- The specific type of playground equipment is not mentioned, so assuming it is a swing is unwarranted.
- The boy's clothing does not provide any information about the type of playground equipment he is using.
- "After school" is a temporal assumption that is not supported by the premise.
- The premise does not indicate whether the boy attends school or whether it is a school day.
- Playing on swings is just one of many possible activities on playground equipment, none of which are specified in the premise.
- The context of the playground equipment could be a public park, a backyard, or a school playground, none of which imply the time or activity.
- The boy's attire is typical and does not suggest any specific activity on the playground equipment.
- The premise lacks causal clues that would link the boy's play to swings specifically.
