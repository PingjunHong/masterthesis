3. The premise describes the boy playing on playground equipment, but does not provide details to confirm he is on swings.
4. The premise describes the boy's clothing and action but does not include information about the specific equipment, leaving the type of equipment neutral between swings and other options.

6. The statement introduces specific elements not mentioned in the premise, like swings and the time of day, which are not logically implied by the premise.
7. The premise's description of playground equipment usage does not logically imply swings specifically, as playground equipment can include various structures.
8. The premise's description of the activity is general and does not logically lead to the conclusion of using swings without additional context.
9. The statement assumes a specific scenario (playing on swings after school) not covered by the logical implications of the premise's description.
10. The premise provides insufficient detail about the playground equipment to logically determine if it includes swings, making the statement neutral.
