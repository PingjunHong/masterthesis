1. The premise specifies that the group of adults and a small child are in the bathroom, but it does not mention if they are inside a house or any other type of building.
2. While it is common for bathrooms to be located inside houses, the premise does not explicitly state that the bathroom is within a house, leaving room for other possibilities.
3. The statement infers a broader location (the house), whereas the premise only confirms the presence of people in a bathroom, making no direct mention of a house.
4. The premise focuses on the interaction between adults and a child in a bathroom setting, but does not provide information about the overall structure or dwelling they are in.
5. The concept of a "house" is introduced in the statement but is not supported by the specific details given in the premise.
6. The presence of people in a bathroom does not necessarily imply they are in a house, as bathrooms can be located in various types of buildings or outdoor settings.
