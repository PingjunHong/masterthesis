1. The premise does not mention the specific nature or duration of work, only that the woman is working long hours, while the hypothesis simply states she is working.
2. The premise specifies "working long hours," but the hypothesis does not mention the length of time she is working, which could be any duration.
3. The premise provides additional context about the duration of work, which is absent in the hypothesis, making it more general and thus potentially true.
4. The hypothesis lacks detail about the hours of work, which is mentioned in the premise, meaning it could be less specific and still true.
5. The premise includes a specific condition about the woman's work hours, but the hypothesis does not specify any such condition, thus it could be true without contradiction.
6. The hypothesis does not include information about the length of time, which is specified in the premise, leaving room for the statement to be true under various circumstances.
7. The premise mentions the woman's working hours, whereas the hypothesis only states she is working, not contradicting or fully supporting the premise's specifics.
