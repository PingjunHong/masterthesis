1. The location "in front of a graffiti-covered wall" in the premise does not explicitly specify whether it is indoors or outdoors, leaving the hypothesis "A person is sitting outside" unresolved.
2. The phrase "in front of a graffiti-covered wall" in the premise might refer to a setting that is either inside or outside, so there is no definitive reference to "outside" in the hypothesis.
3. The reference to the "graffiti-covered wall" does not provide enough context to determine the environment as being outdoors, making the statement "A person is sitting outside" neutral.
4. The description "sitting in front of a graffiti-covered wall" lacks explicit context about the location being outdoors, leaving the hypothesis about sitting outside open to interpretation.
5. It is unclear whether "in front of a graffiti-covered wall" implies an outdoor setting, thus the reference to "outside" in the hypothesis cannot be resolved with certainty.
6. The premise does not specify that the graffiti-covered wall is part of an outdoor environment, so the reference to "outside" in the hypothesis remains ambiguous.
7. The setting described in the premise could be either an inside or outside location, making it impossible to resolve the reference to "outside" in the hypothesis.
8. The phrase "graffiti-covered wall" does not inherently indicate an outdoor setting, so the hypothesis about sitting outside is not explicitly supported by the premise.
