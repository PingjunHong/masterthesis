1. The premise mentions a seagull sitting on the sand, but it does not specify any action taken by the seagull, such as defecating, so this action is not supported by the premise.
2. The premise provides no information about the seagull's behavior beyond sitting, so the additional detail about the seagull defecating is not mentioned or entailed.
3. While the seagull sitting on the sand is described, the premise does not give any evidence of the seagull performing other actions, such as defecating.
4. The hypothesis introduces the idea of the seagull defecating, which is not addressed in the premise and thus lacks supporting evidence.
5. The premise does not specify any actions of the seagull beyond sitting on the sand, leaving the hypothesis unsupported in terms of the seagullâ€™s behavior.
6. The premise does not comment on the seagull's actions other than sitting, so the hypothesis about the seagull defecating is unsubstantiated.
7. The additional detail in the hypothesis about the seagull defecating is not included in the premise and could be true but is not supported by the given description.
