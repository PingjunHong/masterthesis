1. People looking at a camera implies they are not using a computer, as using a computer typically requires looking at the computer screen rather than a camera.
2. The action of looking at a camera in an alley suggests an outdoor setting, while using a computer generally implies being indoors or in a setting where a computer is present.
3. Being in an alley implies a lack of access to computers, as alleys are not typical locations for computer use.
4. The premise involves direct interaction with a camera, which contradicts the implied interaction with a computer in the hypothesis.
5. The physical presence of people in an alley doesn't align with the notion of being engaged with a computer, as using a computer often involves a stationary position and specific equipment not mentioned in the premise.
6. The context of being in an alley and looking at a camera suggests an activity distinct from using a computer, which requires a different focus and equipment setup.
7. The term "looking at the camera" implies active engagement with the camera, which is incompatible with the passive engagement suggested by using a computer.
8. The premise does not include any elements that would typically accompany computer use, such as typing, which contradicts the hypothesis that specifies people are on their computers.
