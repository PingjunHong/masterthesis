- "People" in the statement refers to the "group of people" in the premise, which are seen in an alley, not on computers.
- The "group of people" identified in the alley cannot simultaneously be "on their computer" as stated.
- The reference to "people" on computers contradicts the location of "the group of people" in the alley.
- The group in the alley is visually confirmed to be looking at the camera, not engaging with computers.
- The premise specifies the location as an alley which conflicts with the statement indicating the people are on computers.
- The demonstrative "people" in the statement is resolved as the group in the alley, contradicting the described activity of using computers.
- "People" as referenced in the hypothesis are not performing the action of being on computers as the premise situates them in an alley.
- The resolution of "people" to those in the alley conflicts with the activity of using computers, which is not supported by the premise.
- "A group of people" in the premise is understood to be physically present in an alley, contradicting the hypothesis that they are on computers.
- The statement's reference to "people" assumes an activity of computer use, which is impossible for the group located in an alley according to the premise.
