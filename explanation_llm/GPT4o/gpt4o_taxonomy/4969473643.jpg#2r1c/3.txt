1. "A group of people in an alley looking at the camera" implies they are outdoors, whereas "People are on their computer" implies they are indoors, leading to a contradiction.
2. The premise suggests people are engaged with a camera in an alley, which contradicts the hypothesis suggesting engagement with a computer.
3. Being in an alley and looking at a camera cannot be syntactically rephrased to mean being on a computer, indicating a contradiction.
4. The structural rephrasing of "looking at the camera in an alley" to "being on a computer" changes the context completely, leading to a contradiction.
5. The premise's description of location and activity is inconsistent with the hypothesis's setting and action, as syntactic alternation from an alley to being on a computer is contradictory.
6. Subordinating "looking at the camera" to "being on a computer" is syntactically incompatible, thus contradictory.
7. Coordination of "in an alley looking at the camera" with "on their computer" results in a contradiction due to differing environments and actions.
8. Structural rephrasing from "in an alley" to "on their computer" involves a change in physical location and activity, which is contradictory.
