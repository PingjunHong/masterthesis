1. A group of people standing near and on a large black square on the ground cannot simultaneously have a person lying on a couch, as these are distinct and separate physical scenarios.
2. The context of people standing on a large black square with yellow writing suggests an outdoor or public setting, whereas lying on a couch typically implies an indoor, private setting, making both actions mutually exclusive.
3. The presence of a group of people standing near and on a large black square suggests activity or attention to something specific, which contradicts the passive and relaxed nature of someone lying on a couch.
4. Given that a large black square with yellow writing is typically found in public or outdoor spaces (e.g., street markings, event spaces), it is improbable for someone to lie on a couch in such a setting.
5. The act of standing near and on a large black square signifies engagement in a particular event or situation, which contradicts the typically isolated and restful activity of lying on a couch.
6. The description of a group standing on a large black square suggests an environment that is unsuitable for placing a couch, as this item is usually associated with indoor furnishings.
7. Real-world knowledge about typical human behavior indicates that a group of people involved in an activity outside (on a black square with yellow writing) is inconsistent with someone being alone and inactive on a couch.
8. The scenario of standing around a large black square implies an interaction with the environment or with each other, which is incompatible with the solitary and detached action of lying on a couch.
9. The setting described with a large black square and a group of people suggests a communal or shared activity, which directly contradicts the solitary nature of someone lying on a couch.
10. Probabilistically, in a real-world context, the likelihood of someone lying on a couch in a location where people are gathered on a large black square is extremely low.
