1. The phrase "a person" in the statement does not refer to any individual in the premise, where only a group of people standing is mentioned.
2. The reference to "the couch" in the statement cannot be resolved within the premise, which describes a large black square on the ground, not a couch.
3. The premise mentions people standing, which contradicts the statement indicating a person is lying, as standing and lying are opposing actions.
4. The group of people in the premise does not include a person lying, thus the statement about a person lying contradicts the premise description.
5. The statement implies the presence of a couch, which is not referenced or described in the premise, leading to a contradiction.
6. There is no coreference between the action "lies" in the statement and any action mentioned in the premise, where people are standing.
