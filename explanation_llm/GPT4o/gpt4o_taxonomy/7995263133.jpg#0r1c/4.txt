1. Sleeping and playing soccer are mutually exclusive activities; a boy cannot be doing both simultaneously.
2. A boy lying down in bed indicates inactivity, contradicting the active nature of playing soccer.

4. Wearing pajamas suggests preparation for sleep, not for playing soccer, which typically involves sports attire.
5. The presence of a colorful striped pillow under the boy's head reinforces the context of sleep, not active play like soccer.
6. Lying in bed denotes a stationary position, while playing soccer requires movement and physical engagement.
7. The premise describes a situation of rest and relaxation, whereas playing soccer involves active movement, creating a contradiction.
8. Sleeping requires a lack of consciousness, making it impossible for the boy to consciously play soccer.
9. The scenario of bed and sleep does not align with the outdoor, energetic context typically associated with playing soccer.
10. Playing soccer requires being awake and alert, which contradicts the state of being asleep as described in the premise.
