1. The premise mentions "four women competitively rollerskating," while the hypothesis generalizes this to "women rollerskating," which is consistent with the premise, as the premise includes the scenario of women rollerskating.
2. The activity described in the premise, competitive rollerskating, inherently involves rollerskating, which aligns with the hypothesis stating that women are rollerskating.
3. The premise specifies the number of women and the competitive nature of the activity, but the hypothesis does not contradict this; it simply omits these details, making it a subset of the described situation.
4. The premise provides specific context (four women and competitive rollerskating) that logically contains the broader scenario of women rollerskating as stated in the hypothesis.
5. Rollerskating, whether competitive or recreational, inherently involves the action of skating around an area, thereby satisfying the condition described in the hypothesis.
6. The premise implies the presence of women who are actively engaged in rollerskating, which directly supports the statement that women are rollerskating, as the hypothesis does not specify any additional conditions that contradict the premise.
7. In the real world, if women are competitively rollerskating, it is assumed they are indeed rollerskating, which is the key action described in the hypothesis.
8. The premise explicitly mentions the action and participants involved in rollerskating, allowing for the logical conclusion that the statement about women rollerskating is true based on this information.
9. The presence of four women actively rollerskating competitively inherently supports the hypothesis, as it is part of the broader real-world understanding that such activities involve the action described.
10. Given the context of the premise, the hypothesis is a logically deduced statement derived from the real-world understanding of the activity described, supporting the entailment.
