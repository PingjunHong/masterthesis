1. Ornate buildings are a subset of buildings; therefore, if a man is leaning against a pedestal outside an ornate building, he is also outside a building.
2. Ornate buildings are still buildings in general; hence, being outside an ornate building implies being outside a building.
3. The description of the building as "ornate" is additional information that does not change the fact that it is a building.
4. The action of leaning against a pedestal outside an ornate building inherently involves being outside a building due to the hierarchical nature of "ornate building" being a type of building.
5. In the real world, any ornate structure considered a building falls under the broader category of buildings; hence, the premise logically supports the hypothesis.
6. Causally, leaning against a pedestal outside indicates a location in relation to a building, which aligns with the hypothesis that mentions being outside a building.
7. Probabilistically, if one is outside an ornate building, it is almost certain they are outside a building, because all ornate buildings are inherently buildings.
8. The unstated assumption that an ornate building is a type of building allows the premise to entail the hypothesis based on common understanding of building types.
9. Without additional contextual information suggesting otherwise, it is reasonable to accept that an ornate building is simply a detailed descriptor of a building, hence supporting the entailment.
10. In the absence of contradictory information, the premise that an older man is outside an ornate building is sufficient to conclude he is outside a building based on general world knowledge.
