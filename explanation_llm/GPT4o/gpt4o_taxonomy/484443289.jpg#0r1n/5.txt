1. The premise does not specify the color of the old woman's jean jacket, so we cannot conclude that it is light.
2. The hypothesis assumes the jean jacket is light, but the premise only mentions that the individuals are mostly covered in shadow, providing no evidence about the jacket's color.
3. The description of the jean jacket's color is not mentioned in the premise, leaving the possibility open but unsupported by any specific detail.
4. The shadow covering the old woman and her jean jacket in the premise means the jacket's color is not visible, thus not confirming it as light.
5. The hypothesis introduces the color detail of the jean jacket, which is absent from the premise, making it neither confirmed nor denied.
6. The premise focuses on the presence and attire of the individuals but lacks any mention of the jean jacket's color, rendering the hypothesis unverifiable.
7. The color of the jean jacket is not a detail provided in the premise, leaving the hypothesis's claim unsubstantiated.
8. The shadow mentioned in the premise obscures details like the jacket's color, resulting in no supporting evidence for the hypothesis's claim.
9. Without specific mention of the jean jacket's color in the premise, the hypothesis remains plausible but lacks confirmation.
10. The premise does not address the hue or shade of the jean jacket, creating an absence of evidence for the hypothesis's assertion.
