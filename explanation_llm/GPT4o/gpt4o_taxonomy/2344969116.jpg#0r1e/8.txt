1. The premise describes a scenario where a boy is holding a kettle, and it is implied that it will soon be filled because someone is about to pour something into it.
2. In the real world, when someone holds a kettle and another person is about to pour something into it, it is generally understood that the kettle will be filled soon.
3. The action of pouring something into a kettle naturally leads to the kettle being filled, which is a causal relationship that supports the statement.
4. The description of the boy holding the kettle and someone about to pour something into it suggests that the kettle is intended to be filled, aligning with common expectations.
5. The assumed information is that when a kettle is held and positioned for pouring, the intention is to fill it, which confirms the statement.
6. Probabilistically, if a person is holding a kettle and another person is preparing to pour something, it is highly likely that the kettle will be filled shortly.
7. The real-world understanding is that kettles are typically used to contain liquids, and the action described in the premise indicates that this function is about to be fulfilled.
8. The causal event of pouring liquid into a kettle usually results in the kettle being filled, which directly supports the hypothesis.
9. The premise implies a normal sequence of events where kettles being held are filled when pouring actions are imminent, thus entailing the statement.
10. The scenario described aligns with common practices where a kettle held in anticipation of pouring is meant to be filled, which is unstated but reasonably assumed.
