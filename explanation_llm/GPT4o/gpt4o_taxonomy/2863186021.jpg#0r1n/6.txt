1. "Someone person" implies the presence of at least one individual, and the premise describes a woman, which satisfies this condition.
2. The term "a bunch of birds" in the statement aligns with "a flock of birds" in the premise, indicating the same group of birds.
3. The premise mentions a woman walking towards the flock of birds, which is consistent with someone being near the birds.
4. The description of the womanâ€™s movement towards the flock ensures that the proximity to the birds is satisfied in the statement.
5. The logical structure of "a flock" and "a bunch" does not conflict, as both refer to a group of birds.
6. The temporal aspect is aligned, as the action of walking towards ensures proximity at the time of observation.
7. The lack of specific numerical quantifiers in the statement avoids any conflict with the premise's depiction of the scene.
