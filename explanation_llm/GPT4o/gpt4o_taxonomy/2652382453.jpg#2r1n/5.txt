1. The premise does not specify that people are conducting business; they could be engaged in various activities that do not involve business.
2. The premise only mentions that people are busy, but it does not provide details on what they are doing, so conducting business is just one possibility among many.
3. The premise describes people as being busy, which could involve personal errands, leisure activities, or social interactions, not necessarily business-related tasks.
4. The statement assumes a specific type of activity (business) that is not mentioned in the premise, which leaves room for other interpretations.
5. The premise does not mention the nature of the activities people are engaged in, so the hypothesis introduces new information that is not covered by the premise.
6. Being busy in the city can involve numerous non-business activities, such as commuting, shopping, or exercising, none of which are explicitly mentioned in the premise.
7. The hypothesis assumes a business context without evidence in the premise, which only states a general observation about people being busy.
8. The premise lacks details about the purpose or nature of people's busyness, so the conclusion that they are conducting business is not definitively supported.
9. The statement's focus on business is an unmentioned detail in the premise, which only implies a general sense of busyness or activity.
