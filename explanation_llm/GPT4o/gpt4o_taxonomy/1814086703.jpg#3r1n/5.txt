1. The premise does not specify the dogs' intention or destination, so we cannot conclude they are running to play in the leaves.
2. The premise merely describes the dogs running near the leaves, without mentioning any play-related activity.
3. There is no indication in the premise that the dogs are interacting with the leaves or have any particular interest in them.
4. The premise does not provide information about the dogs' purpose for running, so playing in the leaves is one of many possible reasons.
5. The statement assumes a playful context, which is not supported by the premise, as it only describes the dogs' movement.
6. The premise lacks any mention of the dogs' behavior or actions that signify play.
7. The dogs' proximity to the leaves does not necessarily imply they are running to play in them, as there could be other reasons for their movement.
