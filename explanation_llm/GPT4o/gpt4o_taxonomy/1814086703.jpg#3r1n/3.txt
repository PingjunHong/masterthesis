1. The statement "The two dogs are running to play in the leaves" introduces a purpose for the running, which is not expressed in the premise "Two dogs run together near the leaves."
2. The premise describes the location of the dogs as "near the leaves," whereas the statement suggests a destination or intention of reaching the leaves for play.
3. The premise focuses on the action "run together," but the statement adds a motive "to play in the leaves," which is not a syntactic alternation of the original sentence.
4. The statement changes the role of the leaves from a location to an intended area for play, which is structurally different from the premise's description.
5. The premise expresses a simple action, while the statement adds a layer of causality or intention, altering the syntactic structure.
