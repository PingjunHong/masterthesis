1. Doing gymnastics can include activities other than a handstand, so the statement does not necessarily follow from the content.
2. Using the balance beam does not specify performing a handstand, which is only one possible gymnastics move on the beam.
3. The phrase "doing gymnastics" implies a range of activities, not specifically a handstand, thus the content and statement are not equivalent.
4. The content mentions the use of the balance beam but does not specify what gymnastic move is being performed, leaving the statement unsupported.
5. The structural rephrasing from "doing gymnastics on the balance beam" to "doing a handstand on the balance beam" introduces specificity not present in the original content.
6. The content's syntax allows for multiple gymnastics activities on the balance beam, but the statement specifically narrows it down to a handstand, which is not an explicit rephrase.
7. The action of "using the balance beam" structurally allows for various gymnastic maneuvers, whereas the statement specifies one particular action, making it neutral.
