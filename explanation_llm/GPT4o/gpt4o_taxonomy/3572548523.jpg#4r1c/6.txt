- Walking is not sitting.
- The location conflict between walking down a street and sitting on a bench.
- Temporal conflict: walking indicates movement, while sitting indicates being stationary.
- Structural logical exclusivity: one cannot simultaneously walk and sit.
- A couple in motion cannot be simultaneously stationary.
- The act of walking hand in hand does not align with sitting on a bench.
- The physical posture of sitting is incompatible with the action of walking.
- "Down a street" implies a different location than "on a bench."
- Sitting requires a stationary state, which contradicts the dynamic action of walking.
