1. Purchasing ice cream from a cart implies being outdoors, which contradicts being inside a restaurant.
2. A man and a child do not constitute a couple, which contradicts the statement that a couple is present.
3. Eating in a restaurant implies sitting down at a table, which contradicts the implication of standing or walking while purchasing from a cart.
4. The action of purchasing implies a future intention to consume the ice cream, but it does not confirm that the eating is occurring at that moment, which contradicts the immediate act of eating in a restaurant.
5. An ice cream cart is a mobile vendor typically found on the street, while a restaurant is a stationary establishment, contradicting the location contexts.
6. The presence of a child in the premise contradicts the notion of a couple, typically implying two adults.
7. The premise describes a transaction, whereas the statement describes an act of consumption, which are different actions.
