1. The statement "There is only one person present" contradicts the premise because "a group of football players" implies more than one person.
2. "A group of football players" indicates multiple individuals, which contradicts the statement that suggests a single person.
3. The presence of "a group" in the premise structurally suggests multiple people, directly opposing the statement that claims a singular person.
4. The phrase "a group of football players" syntactically conveys a collective of individuals, which cannot be reconciled with the statement asserting just one person.
5. "A group" implicitly requires more than one member, creating a contradiction with the claim of only one person present.
6. The term "football players" in plural form directly conflicts with the singular notion presented in the statement.
7. The structural use of "is standing behind" in the context of "a group" suggests multiple players are there, contradicting the statement of a single presence.
8. The premise's syntactic structure, implying multiple athletes, cannot logically align with the hypothesis that states there is only one person.
9. The coordination of "a group" with "football players" in the premise indicates plurality, which contradicts the singularity suggested in the hypothesis.
10. The premise implicitly includes at least three people (a group and a coaching official), while the statement reduces the number to one, creating a contradiction.
