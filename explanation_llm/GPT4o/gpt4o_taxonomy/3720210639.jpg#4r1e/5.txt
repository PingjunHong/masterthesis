1. The premise does not specify that the boy is airborne, only that he is in midair, which implies but does not explicitly confirm that he is airborne.
2. The premise mentions "midair," which suggests the boy is above the ground, but does not explicitly state he is airborne, leaving room for interpretation.
3. The term "midair" in the premise could imply the boy is in motion, but it's not explicitly stated that he is airborne, as it could also mean he's at a peak or momentarily suspended.
4. The premise indicates the boy is in midair, which could suggest being airborne, but there is no direct mention that he is not touching the ground.
5. The visual of being "in midair" may imply the boy is airborne, but the premise lacks explicit confirmation of him being entirely off the ground.
6. The hypothesis introduces the concept of being airborne, which aligns with being in midair, but the premise does not confirm the absence of ground contact.
7. While "midair" implies elevation, the hypothesis stating "airborne" is not explicitly mentioned, leaving it open to interpretation.
8. The premise does not provide evidence that the boy is in an airborne state, only that he is in midair, which could be interpreted differently.
