1. Airborne and midair both describe the state of being off the ground, and thus, they can be used interchangeably in this context.
2. The real-world understanding that being in midair means not touching the ground aligns with the concept of being airborne.
3. A bicycle is a common mode of transport that can be used for tricks or jumps, making it realistic for a boy to be airborne while riding it.
4. The law of physics supports that when a bicycle is in midair, its rider is also airborne, establishing a causal relationship.
5. In sports and recreational activities, it is common to see boys performing jumps on bicycles, suggesting that being airborne is a natural occurrence.
6. Stunt performances often involve cyclists getting airborne for brief periods, and a boy can be presumed to be performing such a stunt.
7. Given the context of bicycle tricks, it is probable that the boy is airborne if he is described as being in midair.
8. Understanding the mechanics of cycling and jumping implies the boy must be airborne if his bicycle is in midair.
9. Observing the action sequence in BMX or similar sports illustrates that midair equates to being airborne.
10. Real-world experience with bicycles shows that midair is a direct indication of being airborne during jumps or tricks.
11. The unstated but assumed information is that being in midair inherently means the boy is not in contact with the ground, thus airborne.
