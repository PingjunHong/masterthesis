- The premise does not specify the father's location or activity, so he could be anywhere, not necessarily at work.
- There is no information in the premise about the father's work schedule or occupation, making it unclear when he might be at work.
- Playing with boots does not inherently indicate the father's absence or presence; he could be nearby or not, regardless of whether he is at work.
- The premise lacks any temporal information about when the child is playing with the boots, so it could be at any time of day, not necessarily when the father is at work.
- The father's boots could be accessible to the child at times other than when he is at work, such as during weekends or evenings.
- The premise does not imply any correlation between the child playing with boots and the father's work schedule.
- The premise does not provide details about the father's occupation, making it impossible to assume he is working at the time.
- The child might play with the boots while the father is engaged in other activities, such as resting or performing tasks at home, not exclusively when he is at work.
