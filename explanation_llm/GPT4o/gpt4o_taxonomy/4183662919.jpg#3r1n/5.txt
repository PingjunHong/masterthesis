1. The premise does not mention any information about the father's whereabouts, so we cannot assume he is at work.
2. The father's location is not specified in the premise, thus his being at work is not supported.
3. The premise only describes the child playing with the boots, with no detail about the father's activities, leaving his location unmentioned.
4. The hypothesis introduces the father's absence due to work, which is not indicated in the premise.
5. Although it is possible the father is at work, the premise provides no evidence to support this detail.
6. There is no mention in the premise about what the father is doing, so assuming he is at work lacks supporting information.
7. The premise does not give any context about the father's actions or whereabouts, making the hypothesis about him being at work speculative.
8. The idea that the father is at work is introduced by the hypothesis without evidence from the premise.
9. The father's employment status or schedule is absent in the premise, leaving the hypothesis as an unsupported addition.
10. The premise lacks any mention of the father's work routine, making the hypothesis neutral due to this absence of information.
