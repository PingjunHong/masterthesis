1. A lioness cannot be both closing in on its prey and sleeping at the same time.
2. The action of closing in on prey requires being awake and alert, which contradicts the state of sleeping.
3. The state of being asleep negates the ability to actively pursue prey.
4. Closing in on prey implies movement and activity, which is incompatible with the inactivity of sleeping.
5. The logical structure of pursuing prey excludes the possibility of being asleep.
6. To close in on prey, a lioness must be conscious, which is not the case if it is sleeping.
7. The temporal conflict arises because the simultaneous occurrence of hunting and sleeping is impossible.
8. The exclusive nature of the activities—hunting versus sleeping—creates a contradiction.
9. The act of a lioness attempting to catch prey requires being awake, not asleep.
10. The physical state required to close in on prey conflicts with the state of sleeping.
11. Sleeping implies a lack of awareness or movement, which contradicts the awareness required to close in on prey.
