4. Hunting behavior in lionesses is characterized by wakefulness and attention, contrary to the state of sleeping.
5. The physiological state required for a lioness to hunt is incompatible with the state of sleep.
6. A sleeping lioness cannot exhibit active predatory behaviors like closing in on prey.
7. The logical sequence of a lioness stalking prey excludes the possibility of her being asleep simultaneously.
8. Real-world understanding of lion behavior dictates that a lioness cannot be both hunting and sleeping at the same time.
9. The action of closing in on prey indicates a conscious and deliberate act, which is impossible if the lioness is asleep.
10. In the natural world, a lioness must be awake to engage in the act of hunting, which contradicts her being asleep.
