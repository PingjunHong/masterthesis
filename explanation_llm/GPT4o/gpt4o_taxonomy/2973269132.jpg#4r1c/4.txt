A lioness that is closing in on its prey is actively engaging in hunting behavior and cannot be sleeping at the same time.
Closing in on prey implies movement and alertness, which are incompatible with the state of sleeping.
Hunting requires focus and physical activity, both of which contradict the state of being asleep.
The action of closing in on prey necessitates being awake and aware, directly opposing the state of sleep.
Sleeping implies inactivity and lack of movement, which contradicts the active pursuit described in closing in on prey.
Being asleep means the lioness is not conscious or engaging in purposeful actions, whereas closing in on prey requires conscious effort.
A lioness cannot simultaneously perform the active hunting behavior of closing in on prey and be asleep, as these states are mutually exclusive.
