1. Preparing a fish at a dock implies that the men are on land, whereas sitting in a canoe suggests they are on water.
2. Preparing a fish requires a stable surface, which a dock provides, but a canoe is not stable enough for such an activity.
3. The activity of preparing a fish typically involves cleaning or gutting, which is more feasible on a dock than in a canoe.
4. Sitting in a canoe with fishing poles suggests that the men are still engaged in fishing, not preparing a fish that is already caught.
5. The presence of fishing poles implies an activity of fishing rather than preparing a fish, indicating a different stage of the fishing process.
6. Canoes are used for being on water, whereas the act of preparing a fish at a dock implies they are not in a canoe.
7. A dock provides the necessary space and equipment for preparing a fish, which a canoe does not offer.
8. Preparing a fish typically follows fishing, suggesting the fish is caught, while sitting in a canoe with fishing poles suggests active fishing.
9. The contradiction arises because the premise involves handling a fish post-catch, while the statement involves being in the act of catching fish.
10. Preparing a fish at a dock implies access to tools and cleaning facilities, which are not available in a canoe.
