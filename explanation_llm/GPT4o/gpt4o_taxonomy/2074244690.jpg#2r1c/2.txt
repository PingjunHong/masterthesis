1. "Gathered" implies being awake and alert, whereas "asleep" implies being inactive and unconscious.
2. "Watching an event" suggests attentiveness and engagement, which contradicts "asleep," indicating lack of awareness.
3. "Night" allows for the possibility of being awake, while "asleep" explicitly states unconsciousness during that time.
4. "Gathered" involves social activity and interaction, which is incompatible with "asleep," indicating solitude and inaction.
5. "People" being "gathered" suggests a conscious presence, directly opposing "asleep," which means unconsciousness.
6. "Watching" indicates visual engagement and consciousness, which cannot occur if the group is "asleep."
7. "Event" implies an occurrence worth observing, contradicting "asleep," which suggests no awareness of external happenings.
8. "Gathered at night" does not inherently mean sleep, creating a contradiction with the group being "asleep."
