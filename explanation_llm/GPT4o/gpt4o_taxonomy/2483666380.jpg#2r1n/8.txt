1. Holding a comb does not inherently indicate that the woman is at work, as combs are not typically tools used for professional weaving.
2. Weaving with a comb in hand could be a leisure activity or hobby, not necessarily work-related.
3. The presence of a comb in weaving is unusual and doesn't directly correlate with a professional setting or work environment.
4. A woman engaging in weaving could be doing so for personal enjoyment or artistic expression, not as part of her occupation.
5. The act of weaving does not specify the context of employment; it could occur in a domestic setting unrelated to work.
6. The description doesn't include any details that suggest employment, such as a workplace or company association.
7. Weaving could be part of a cultural or traditional activity rather than a professional task.
8. The presence of a comb doesn't provide enough context to determine the woman's employment status or setting.
9. The premise lacks explicit indicators of professional context, such as uniforms, tools of the trade, or workplace location.
10. Weaving as an activity can be performed by individuals of various professions or by those not employed, making the work-related inference uncertain.
