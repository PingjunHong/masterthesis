1. Dogs cannot be both running and sleeping simultaneously due to the nature of these activities.
2. Running requires active movement and wakefulness, while sleeping is a state of rest and inactivity.
3. If the dogs are running, they must be awake and alert, contradicting the state of being asleep.
4. The description of the dogs running indicates they are not stationary, which contradicts the idea of them lying still on a pile of leaves.
5. The physical exertion of running is incompatible with the relaxation required for sleeping.
6. The phrase "run together" implies coordinated and energetic activity, which is inconsistent with sleeping on leaves.
7. The presence of leaves may suggest a natural environment, but it does not provide information supporting simultaneous running and sleeping.
8. Dogs running nearby indicates their position relative to the leaves, contrary to the statement of them being on the leaves while asleep.
9. The activity of running inherently involves consciousness, while sleeping involves a lack of consciousness.
10. The need for dogs to be alert and responsive while running contradicts their inability to do so if they are asleep.
