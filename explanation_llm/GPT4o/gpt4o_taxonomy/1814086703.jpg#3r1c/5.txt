1. The premise mentions two dogs running near the leaves, but it does not provide any information about the dogs sleeping or resting.
2. The activity described in the premise is running, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis stating that the dogs are sleeping.
3. The premise does not mention a pile of leaves, only that the dogs are near leaves, leaving the presence of a pile unconfirmed.
4. There is no information in the premise about the dogs stopping or resting, which is necessary to support the sleeping scenario in the hypothesis.
5. The premise lacks details about the dogs' state of rest or inactivity, making the hypothesis about them sleeping unsupported.
6. The hypothesis introduces the idea of a pile, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise.
7. The premise does not include any evidence or implication that the dogs would transition from running to sleeping.
8. The hypothesis suggests a different location (on the pile of leaves) from what is indicated in the premise (near the leaves).
9. The premise does not indicate any change in the dogs' activity from running, as opposed to the hypothesis suggesting they are now sleeping.
