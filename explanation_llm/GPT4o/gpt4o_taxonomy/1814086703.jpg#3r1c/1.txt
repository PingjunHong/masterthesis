1. "The two dogs" in the statement refers to the "two dogs" in the premise, which are running, not sleeping.
2. "The leaves" in the statement refers to the "leaves" in the premise, which are near the running dogs, not where they are sleeping.
3. "Sleeping on the pile of leaves" contradicts "run together near the leaves," as the dogs can't be both running and sleeping simultaneously.
4. The reference to "two dogs" is consistent in both premise and statement, but their actions—running versus sleeping—are contradictory.
5. "Near the leaves" refers to the location of the dogs in the premise, indicating they are not sleeping on the leaves as stated.
6. The statement's "pile of leaves" does not correspond to any specific location in the premise, which only mentions leaves near which the dogs are running.
7. The activity described in the premise ("run together") directly contradicts the activity described in the statement ("sleeping"), despite the shared reference.
