1. The number of women singers on the stage is three, which is greater than the number of men singers, which is two, confirming there are more females than males.
2. Given the information that there are three female singers and two male singers, the count of females exceeds that of males, aligning with the statement.
3. The premise specifies three women and two men, totaling to five singers, and since three is greater than two, the statement about more females is true.
4. In the context of the stage setup, the explicit mention of three women compared to two men directly supports the claim of more females than males.
5. Based on the numerical comparison in the premise, the ratio of women to men (3:2) directly leads to the conclusion that females outnumber males.
6. When the premise indicates three women and two men, the logical conclusion using basic arithmetic is that the quantity of females surpasses that of males.
7. Real-world understanding of numbers confirms that with three females and two males, the females are in greater number.
8. The situation described explicitly counts more females (three) than males (two), making the statement a factual entailment.
9. The distribution of singers as three women and two men inherently means that the number of women exceeds the number of men.
10. The presence of three female singers compared to two male singers naturally results in a higher count of females, validating the statement.
