1. If a man is wearing a black shirt, then he cannot simultaneously be wearing a red shirt.
2. The color of the shirt described in the premise is black, which contradicts the description of the man wearing a red shirt in the statement.
3. A single individual cannot wear two shirts of different colors at the same time, hence the premise and statement are contradictory.
4. The premise specifies the shirt color as black, which inherently contradicts any statement claiming the shirt is red.
5. The logical implication of wearing a black shirt excludes the possibility of wearing a red shirt concurrently.
