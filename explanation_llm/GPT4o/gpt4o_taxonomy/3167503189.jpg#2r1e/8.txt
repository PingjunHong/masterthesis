1. Being "against" a wall can include holding onto it, as the boy's position implies contact or proximity to the wall.
2. Raised foundations typically have walls, and holding onto a wall suggests physical support or proximity to it.
3. The description "old brick house's raised foundation" suggests the presence of a wall, which the boy is holding onto, supporting the idea that he is against it.
4. Real-world understanding of "holding onto" implies closeness or support against a surface, aligning with being "against" the wall.
5. Raised foundations are generally understood to have walls, so the boy holding onto it naturally implies he is against the wall.
6. Probabilistically, if someone is holding onto a wall, they are likely also positioned against it for support or balance.
7. The assumed spatial relationship between "holding onto" and "against" indicates physical proximity, making the statement entailment.
8. In real-world scenarios, holding onto a structure's wall often involves being against it, which is consistent with the hypothesis.
9. The nature of holding onto a structure for support suggests being physically against it, aligning with common real-world behavior.
10. Unstated but assumed understanding of physical interaction with a wall implies being against it, supporting the entailment.
