1. Tending to a garden does not necessarily involve weeding; it could involve other activities like watering, planting, or pruning.
2. The action of tending to a garden does not logically imply that the specific task of weeding is being performed.
3. The premise describes a general activity of garden maintenance, which includes various tasks, not exclusively weeding.
4. The lady might be engaged in any number of gardening activities, and weeding is just one of many possibilities.
5. The statement about weeding introduces a specific action not explicitly mentioned or logically implied in the premise.
6. The premise lacks specific details about the gardening tasks, so the hypothesis about weeding cannot be definitively inferred.
7. Weeding is one possible interpretation of tending, but without explicit mention, it remains speculative.
8. The hypothesis assumes a specific gardening activity not conclusively supported by the general description in the premise.
9. The premise does not provide enough information to determine whether weeding is occurring, leaving the hypothesis as a possible but not necessary scenario.
10. The premise's description of gardening activities is broad and non-specific, preventing a definitive conclusion about weeding.
