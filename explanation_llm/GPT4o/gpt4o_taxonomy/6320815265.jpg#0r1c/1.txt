1. The streets in the premise refer to the area where spectators are lining up, while the hypothesis claims the streets are empty.
2. "The streets" in the hypothesis refers to the same streets mentioned in the premise where spectators are present, creating a contradiction.
3. In the premise, "spectators line the street" indicates the presence of people on the streets, contradicting the hypothesis that states the streets are empty.
4. The reference to "the street" in both the premise and the hypothesis identifies the same location, which cannot simultaneously be lined with spectators and empty.
5. The mention of "spectators" in the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis's assertion that "the streets are empty," as both refer to the same streets.
