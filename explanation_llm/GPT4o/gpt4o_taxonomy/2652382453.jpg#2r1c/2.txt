1. The word "busy" implies engagement in activities that do not involve observing others, while "watching" indicates a focus on observing events or people, creating a contradiction.
2. "Doing their own thing" suggests self-involvement, which conflicts with "watching what is happening," indicating attention to external events.
3. "Everyone on the street" being "busy" contradicts the idea of them "watching," as being busy generally means not focusing on external occurrences.
4. The phrase "seem to be busy" implies a lack of attention towards others, which is inconsistent with "watching what is happening," requiring an outward focus.
5. The antonyms "busy" and "watching" convey conflicting states of action versus observation, leading to a contradiction.
6. The phrase "their own thing" suggests individual activities, contradicting "watching what is happening," which implies a collective or shared focus.
7. "Busy" denotes active engagement, while "watching" suggests a more passive activity, thus creating a semantic contradiction.
