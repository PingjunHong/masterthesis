1. The colorful bikini mentioned in the premise is a specific detail that does not alter the fact that the woman is wearing a bikini, which matches the description in the hypothesis.
2. The action of resting and laying down near the water directly supports the hypothesis that the woman is laying near the water, as resting implies a position of laying down.
3. The presence of "blue water" in the premise confirms the setting of being near water, aligning with the hypothesis.
4. The premise explicitly states a woman is laying down, which inherently includes the action of laying near something, such as water.
5. The premise does not introduce any other location or activity that would contradict the hypothesis of the woman being near the water.
6. The real-world understanding that wearing a bikini is common attire for being near water supports the hypothesis.
7. The premise describes a single woman, which corresponds directly to the singular mention of a woman in the hypothesis.
8. The colorful bikini is a visual detail that doesn't affect the truth of the woman being in a bikini, as described in the hypothesis.
9. The assumption that colorful attire does not change the basic fact of wearing a bikini supports the hypothesis.
10. Probabilistic reasoning suggests that if a woman is laying next to water, it is logical she is laying near it, as the hypothesis states.
