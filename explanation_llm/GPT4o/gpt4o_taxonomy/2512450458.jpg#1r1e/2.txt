1. The word "speed through the water" implies movement in the water rather than being above it.
2. "Above the water" suggests being on the surface or out of the water, contrasting with the activity described in the premise.
3. "Snorkel and goggles" indicate underwater activity, which does not support the idea of being above the water.
4. "Speed through the water" can occur underwater or at the surface, making the location ambiguous.
5. "Another person" does not specify gender, making "two guys" an assumption not directly supported by the premise.
