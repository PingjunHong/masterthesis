1. Wearing snorkel and goggles doesn't necessarily mean being above the water; they could be wearing them while in the water.
2. Speeding through the water could imply being underwater or above it; the premise doesn't specify their position relative to the water's surface.
3. The presence of a snorkel and goggles suggests they might be underwater, but it doesn't confirm it, leaving open the possibility they could be above the water.
4. The thumbs up gesture can be made either underwater or above, so it doesn't clarify the location of the individuals.
5. The premise mentions "speeding through the water," which can occur in various scenarios, such as swimming, diving, or using a vessel, leaving their exact position ambiguous.
6. The equipment described (snorkel and goggles) is typically used for underwater activity, but the premise doesn't confirm they are submerged.
7. The premise doesn't specify whether the individuals are using any watercraft, which could affect their position relative to the water.
8. "Another person" in the premise is unspecified and could be a swimmer or diver, leaving their exact position relative to the water unclear.
9. The term "speed through the water" doesn't specify if they are on, above, or below the surface, nor does it specify the method of movement.
10. Being a "man" doesn't inherently imply the gender of the other person, nor does it confirm both individuals are above the water.
