- If a woman is singing on stage, then it logically follows that a woman is singing.
- The premise states that a woman is singing, which directly supports the hypothesis that a woman is singing.
- The presence of "on stage" in the premise does not negate the act of singing, thus the statement is inferred.
- The premise describes an action (singing) performed by a woman, which aligns exactly with the hypothesis.
- The descriptor "goofy looking" does not affect the core action of singing, confirming the hypothesis.
- The subject "a goofy looking woman" implies the existence of "a woman," fulfilling the hypothesis requirement.
- Singing on stage entails singing, as the action is explicitly mentioned in the premise.
- The hypothesis is a simpler form of the premise, maintaining all essential information related to the action and subject.
- The logical structure of the premise inherently includes the simpler action described in the hypothesis.
