1. "A group of friends" in the statement does not specifically refer to "a group of people" in the content, as the group in the content could be strangers, not necessarily friends.
2. The term "the music concert" in the statement does not have a direct reference in the content, which only mentions "an event" without specifying its nature.
3. The phrase "watching the music concert" in the statement cannot be resolved to the event in the content, as the content does not explicitly identify the event as a music concert.
4. The statement specifies "friends," while the content uses "people," and there is no information to confirm that the people are indeed friends, making the reference unclear.
5. The content mentions "an event" without specifying it as a music concert, leaving the reference to the event in the statement unresolved.
6. There is no indication in the content that the people gathered are friends, so the reference to "friends" in the statement remains unresolved.
7. The reference to "night" is consistent in both the content and the statement, but the specific nature of the event being a music concert is not established, leading to unresolved references.
