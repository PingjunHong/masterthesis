1. The term "lake" does not specifically align with "water," as water could refer to various bodies of water, not just a lake.
2. The word "guys" is not explicitly synonymous with "man" and "another person," which may not both be male.
3. "Speed through the water" does not imply a specific location like a lake, as it could happen in oceans, rivers, or pools.
4. The action of giving a thumbs up is unrelated to the location being a lake.
5. The gear mentioned, "snorkel and goggles," is typically associated with swimming or diving activities, not specifically with lakes.
6. The presence of "another person" does not confirm that both individuals are "guys."
7. The concept of "speeding" suggests motion, which does not inherently indicate the specific environment of a lake.
8. The premise does not specify the number of people as "two guys," but rather refers to a "man" and "another person," leaving gender ambiguous.
