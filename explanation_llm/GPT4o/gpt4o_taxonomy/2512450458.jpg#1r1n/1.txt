1. "A man" in the content could refer to any man, not necessarily one of the "two guys" in the statement.
2. "Another person" in the content does not specifically resolve to "two guys" in the statement.
3. "Through the water" in the content does not specify the setting as a "lake" in the statement.
4. "He and another person" in the content may not both be men, thus not directly supporting the "two guys" reference in the statement.
5. The content describes "a man" and "another person," which may not both be male, leaving the statement about "two guys" unresolved.
6. The "thumbs up" action in the content does not clarify whether it involves two men, leaving the statement about "two guys" ambiguous.
7. The specific mention of "a snorkel and goggles" does not determine that these items are related to "two guys" in the statement.
8. The environment described as "speed through the water" doesn't directly connect to "on a lake" from the statement, leaving the reference unclear.
9. The content's lack of explicit mention of a lake means the location referenced in the statement remains unresolved.
10. The content does not specify the gender of "another person," so it cannot definitively be inferred that both are "guys" as stated.
