1. The premise describes a group of individuals who are wearing rafting gear and are actively rafting, which implies they are all still in the boat, not fallen out.
2. The statement refers to a single man falling out, but the premise mentions a group of seven individuals, with no indication of anyone falling out.
3. The premise uses "rafting" as an activity involving staying in the boat, while the statement suggests someone has exited the boat involuntarily, which is contradictory.
4. The word "rafting" in the premise suggests that the individuals are navigating the river in their raft, not that anyone has fallen out.
5. The premise describes the action of rafting, which involves staying on the raft, contrasting with the statement that someone has fallen out of the boat.
6. The term "group" in the premise implies collective action and unity in the boat, directly opposing the statement of an individual falling out.
