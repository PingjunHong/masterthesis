1. The group of seven individuals is described as being in a raft, which implies that they are all inside the boat, whereas the statement claims that the man has fallen out of the boat, creating a contradiction.
2. The premise describes individuals wearing rafting gear and participating in rafting, which suggests they are all actively taking part in rafting inside the raft, contradicting the claim that one has fallen out.
3. The description of the action "white water raft down a river" logically implies that the individuals remain on the raft, contradicting the statement that a man has fallen out.
4. The use of "a group of seven individuals" suggests they are together and intact within the raft, contradicting the claim that one member is no longer in the boat.
5. The premise suggests a collective activity of rafting, which requires all participants to remain in the raft, conflicting with the statement that one participant has fallen out.
6. The scenario of "rafting down a river" inherently implies staying in the raft for safety and participation, which contradicts the idea of someone falling out.
7. The premise's focus on the group rafting implies stability and unity in the activity, which is contradicted by the hypothesis that a man has fallen out of the boat.
