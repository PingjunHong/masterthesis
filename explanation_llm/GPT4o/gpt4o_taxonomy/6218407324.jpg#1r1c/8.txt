1. The statement implies a mishap or accident, whereas the premise describes a successful rafting activity with no mention of anyone falling out.
2. The statement suggests an individual has been separated from the group, which contradicts the premise that depicts the group as a cohesive unit navigating the river together.
3. The premise implies that all individuals are still in the boat, as it describes them rafting down the river, whereas the statement asserts that one person has fallen out.
4. Falling out of a boat would typically interrupt the activity, but the premise describes the group continuing down the river, indicating no such interruption has occurred.
5. The premise does not mention any accidents or incidents, whereas the statement specifically describes one, indicating a contradiction in the events described.
6. Rafting gear is designed to keep individuals safe and secure in the boat; the statement suggests a failure of this gear, which is not indicated in the premise.
7. The premise suggests a standard rafting scenario with everyone paddling together, contradicting the statement that implies an individual has fallen into the water.
8. The statement indicates a change in the group's situation not accounted for in the premise, which describes a collective activity without disruption.
9. White water rafting requires coordinated effort, and the statement implies a disruption not mentioned in the premise, where the group remains intact and active.
10. The premise describes a continuing action of rafting, while the statement suggests an interruption, which is a logical contradiction.
