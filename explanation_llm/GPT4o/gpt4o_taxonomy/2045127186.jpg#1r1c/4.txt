1. The premise describes a girl in a red coat making a snow angel, while the hypothesis describes a girl in a black coat staying indoors, indicating that they are different individuals or scenarios.

3. The premise specifies that the girl is wearing a red coat, whereas the hypothesis mentions a black coat, suggesting a contradiction in the description of the coat's color.
4. The mention of a snow angel in the premise implies presence in the snow, directly contradicting the hypothesis where the girl avoids the snow by staying indoors.
5. The contrast between the outdoor activity in the premise and the indoor setting in the hypothesis creates a direct contradiction in the actions described.
6. The premise involves being actively engaged with snow, which contradicts the hypothesis' implication of avoiding snow altogether by staying inside.
