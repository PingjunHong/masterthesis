1. "Girl in a black coat stays indoors away from the snow" directly contradicts "Girl in a red coat, blue head wrap and jeans is making a snow angel" because staying indoors is the opposite of being outside making a snow angel.
2. "Girl in a black coat" contrasts with "Girl in a red coat," indicating two different scenarios involving different clothing, which cannot occur simultaneously in the context provided.
3. "Stays indoors away from the snow" opposes "making a snow angel," as the latter requires being outside in the snow.
4. The act of "staying indoors" versus "making a snow angel" suggests mutually exclusive actions; one cannot be indoors and outside in the snow simultaneously.
5. The clothing described in the hypothesis ("black coat") is inconsistent with the clothing described in the premise ("red coat, blue head wrap and jeans"), highlighting a contradiction in visual appearance and activity.
6. "Making a snow angel" implies interaction with snow, which directly contradicts "stays indoors away from the snow," involving no contact with snow.
7. The structural rephrasing of location and activity—indoors and away from snow versus outside in the snow—illustrates a contradiction.
