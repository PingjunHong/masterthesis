1. The term "ornate building" does not necessarily imply a nursing home, as nursing homes can be of various architectural styles.
2. "Leaning against a pedestal" does not specify the location or type of building, so it cannot confirm the nursing home setting.
3. The word "pedestal" is not synonymous with "nursing home," thus the specific location in the hypothesis is not confirmed by the premise.
4. "Outside of an ornate building" and "outside his nursing home" describe different potential environments, with no direct synonymy or antonymy link.
5. The word "outside" is common to both statements but does not infer the specific type of building in the hypothesis.
6. The premise describes "an ornate building," which by word meaning does not specifically denote a nursing home.
7. "Ornate" and "nursing home" refer to different concepts; one is about architectural style, and the other is about function or purpose.
8. The phrase "leans against a pedestal" does not provide information about the building's function or name, thus does not infer a nursing home setting.
9. The hypothesis introduces the concept of "his nursing home," which is not mentioned or implied by the words in the premise.
