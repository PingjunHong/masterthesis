1. "An older man" in the statement may not refer to the same individual as "an older man" in the content, as there is no information connecting the specific locations.
2. The "pedestal outside of an ornate building" in the content is not clearly identified as a "nursing home" in the statement, leading to ambiguity in reference.
3. "Outside of an ornate building" in the content does not specify or confirm that the location is a "nursing home," leaving room for multiple interpretations.
4. The statement's reference to "his nursing home" does not uniquely resolve to the "ornate building" in the content, as ownership and identity are not established.
5. The use of "outside his nursing home" introduces a new entity that is not mentioned in the content, creating a possible divergence in reference.
6. The statement implies a personal connection ("his nursing home") which is not supported by the generic description of the location in the content.
7. There is no direct indication that the "ornate building" is a nursing home, meaning the references to the building differ between the premise and hypothesis.
8. "Leaning outside his nursing home" does not match the context of "leaning against a pedestal," suggesting different referential contexts.
