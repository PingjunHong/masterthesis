1. Spitting water out doesn’t necessarily indicate the swimmer almost drowned; it could be a normal action after swimming.
2. Grabbing someone's hand for help does not imply the swimmer was in danger; it could be a routine post-swim action.
3. The premise doesn’t mention any dangerous conditions like a fast current, so the hypothesis is not directly supported.
4. Being helped back to land doesn’t automatically mean the swimmer experienced a near-drowning incident.
5. The act of spitting water could be due to various reasons, such as an exercise routine, rather than a near-drowning event.
6. The premise lacks any explicit mention of a fast current or any indication of danger, making the hypothesis speculative.
7. Assistance from another person might be a precautionary measure rather than a response to a life-threatening situation.
8. The context of water activities can involve spitting water without any implication of distress or emergency.
9. The swimmer’s actions described could be part of a training drill, not a rescue scenario.
10. Without explicit mention of a fast current or signs of distress, the premise does not logically lead to the conclusion of almost drowning.
