1. The premise mentions the swimmer spitting water out and being helped back to land, but does not specify any details about a fast current or drowning, making it unclear if the swimmer almost drowned.
2. Surfacing and spitting water could occur under various circumstances, not exclusively due to being sucked under a fast current.
3. The premise describes a scenario where help is provided, but it doesn't logically imply that the swimmer was in a life-threatening situation like almost drowning.
4. The act of grabbing someone's hand for help could be due to fatigue or precaution, rather than a near-drowning experience.
5. Spitting water out after surfacing can be a normal reaction for swimmers and does not necessarily indicate distress or a dangerous situation.
6. The premise lacks any explicit mention of danger or a fast current that could support the hypothesis of almost drowning.
7. Being helped back to land does not inherently suggest that the swimmer was in imminent danger, as assistance can be routine in various aquatic activities.
8. The premise does not provide any information about the conditions of the water, such as speed or current, which would be necessary to infer a near-drowning incident.
9. The premise focuses on the swimmer's actions after surfacing, without detailing the events that led to him needing assistance, leaving the cause of the situation ambiguous.
