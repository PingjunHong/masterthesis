1. The premise describes a person wearing specific clothing and in a hunched position, but it does not specify the person's gender.
2. The semantic content of the premise does not include any gender indicators, so there is no logical basis to infer that the person is a woman.
3. The description of clothing and posture in the premise is gender-neutral and does not logically imply any specific gender.
4. The premise solely mentions the color of clothing and the person's posture, lacking any information that would logically necessitate the person being a woman.
