1. Working and having a beer are mutually exclusive activities occurring simultaneously.
2. The act of sawing a log requires active engagement, which is incompatible with the act of having a beer at the same time.
3. Being engaged in physical work suggests the men are not in a setting conducive to drinking beer.
4. The context of working implies a different temporal or situational setting than relaxing and having a beer.
5. If the men are actively working, they are not in a scenario where they could also be drinking beer.
6. The physical exertion involved in sawing a log conflicts with the leisure implied by having a beer.
7. The setting implied by working (e.g., a worksite) contradicts the setting suggested by having a beer (e.g., a bar or home).
8. The simultaneous occurrence of two mutually exclusive states (working and having a beer) is logically impossible.
9. The statement of engaging in active labor contradicts the implied inactivity or relaxation of having a beer.
10. If two men are in the midst of sawing a log, they are not in a context where social drinking typically occurs.
