1. The term "boys" directly contradicts "girls," as boys and girls are distinct genders.
2. There is no mention of girls in the premise, so the statement that there are three girls does not align with the given information.
3. The premise specifically identifies "three boys," which cannot simultaneously be "three girls" due to gender distinction.
4. Real-world understanding dictates that boys cannot be referred to as girls unless specified differently, which is not the case in the premise.
5. The premise provides a specific number of boys, which directly contradicts the statement claiming the presence of girls.
6. Based on real-world knowledge, the premise and statement describe mutually exclusive groups (boys versus girls).
7. The presence of "white shirts" may imply a uniform setting, but it does not change the gender of the individuals described in the premise.
8. The assumption that boys can be girls is not supported by the premise's depiction or any unstated real-world information.
9. Logical reasoning based on gender classification asserts that the premise contradicts the statement regarding the presence of girls.
10. Probabilistic reasoning suggests that the likelihood of the three boys being girls is zero based on the given premise.
