1. Soccer uniforms are specifically designed for playing soccer, while band uniforms are designed for musical performances, and these two types of uniforms are distinct and serve different purposes.
2. Soccer uniforms typically include shorts and jerseys suited for athletic activity, which differ in style and function from band uniforms that are often more formal and decorative.
3. The activity of washing hands in an adult-sized bathroom while wearing soccer uniforms does not align with any typical scenario involving band uniforms, which are usually worn during musical events or parades.
4. The context of using a wooden set of steps to wash hands suggests a casual or playful setting, which contrasts with the formal or performance context usually associated with band uniforms.
5. The description of "blue soccer uniforms" directly contradicts "band uniforms" since they are two specific and different types of attire with different associated activities and uses.
6. Boys in soccer uniforms are likely engaged in or coming from a sports event, whereas band uniforms suggest participation in a music-related event, making the two incompatible in this context.
7. The premise explicitly states "soccer uniforms," which are not interchangeable with "band uniforms" in terms of design, purpose, or typical use.
8. The function and appearance of soccer uniforms are generally understood to be for sports, whereas band uniforms are for musical or ceremonial purposes, making the statement logically inconsistent with the premise.
9. The real-world context and assumed knowledge about uniforms indicate that wearing soccer uniforms and band uniforms are mutually exclusive scenarios in the described situation.
10. The material and style of soccer uniforms, built for physical exertion and flexibility, are not compatible with the typically more rigid and ornate construction of band uniforms.
