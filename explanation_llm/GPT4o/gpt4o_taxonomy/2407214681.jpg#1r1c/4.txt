- Soccer uniforms are distinct from band uniforms in terms of purpose and design, and the boys are described as wearing soccer uniforms, not band uniforms.
- The blue uniforms mentioned are specifically soccer uniforms, which are typically athletic and made for sports, whereas band uniforms are typically formal and designed for performances, indicating a contradiction.
- The context of washing hands in an adult-sized bathroom does not suggest any musical activity or attire, reinforcing that the uniforms are not band uniforms.
- The premise specifies the uniform type as soccer, which logically excludes them from being band uniforms due to the distinct nature of these uniforms.
- The description of the activity involving washing hands does not align with any stereotype or common scenario where band uniforms would be worn, further contradicting the statement.
- The term "soccer" in the premise inherently rules out "band" as the type of uniform, considering the exclusive nature of uniform categorization within the text.
