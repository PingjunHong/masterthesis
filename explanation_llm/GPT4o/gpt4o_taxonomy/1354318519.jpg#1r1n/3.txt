1. "The boy doesn't want to see his reflection" is not a syntactic rephrase of "a boy in a red hooded top is smiling whilst looking away from his reflection."
2. The premise describes the physical action of looking away from the reflection, whereas the statement suggests an intentional desire not to see it, indicating different meanings.
3. The premise uses "looking away" to describe the boy's action, which structurally does not imply a reason or intention like "doesn't want."
4. There is no coordination or subordination in the premise that directly translates to the intention expressed in the statement.
5. The premise focuses on the boy's action and appearance, while the statement infers a psychological state without rephrasing the premise's structure.
