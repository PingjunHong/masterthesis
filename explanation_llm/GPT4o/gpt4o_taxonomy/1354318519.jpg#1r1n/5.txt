- The premise mentions the boy looking away from his reflection, but it doesn't provide any information about his desires or intentions regarding seeing it.
- The boy could be looking away for any number of reasons unrelated to a desire not to see his reflection, such as being distracted or simply looking at something else.
- Smiling while looking away from his reflection does not necessarily indicate a dislike or aversion to seeing it; the smile could imply contentment or happiness.
- The premise does not mention any feelings of avoidance or dislike towards the reflection, so it's unclear why the boy is looking away.
- There is no mention of the boy's feelings or thoughts about his reflection in the premise, so the hypothesis could be true but is not supported by the given information.
- The absence of a direct statement or evidence about the boy's intentions towards his reflection leaves the hypothesis unsupported by the premise.
- The premise lacks any mention of the boy's desires or motivations regarding his reflection, making it impossible to determine if he actively doesn't want to see it.
