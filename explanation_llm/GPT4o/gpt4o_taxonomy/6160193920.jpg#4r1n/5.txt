1. The premise does not provide any information about the woman's age, so we cannot determine if she is young or not.
2. The description of clothing and facial expression doesn't imply anything about the woman's age.
3. The color of the headscarf and shirt does not give any clues about the woman's age.
4. A big grin does not indicate whether the woman is young or old.
5. There is no mention of the woman's age in the premise, so the hypothesis about her being young is not supported.
6. The premise only describes the woman's appearance, not her age.
7. The woman's age is not mentioned, so the hypothesis introduces unsupported information.
8. The clothing and expression might belong to a person of any age, and age is not specified in the premise.
9. The hypothesis assumes information (age) that is not present in the premise.
10. The premise lacks any mention of age, making the hypothesis about youth unsupported.
