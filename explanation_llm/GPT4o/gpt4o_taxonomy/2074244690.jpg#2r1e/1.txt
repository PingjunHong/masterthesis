1. The group of humans mentioned refers to the group of people gathered.
2. The direction they are looking at is not specified, so it cannot be confirmed if everyone is watching the event.
3. "People" and "humans" are coreferential, but their specific activities are not detailed enough to establish a direct connection.
4. The event being watched is not explicitly referenced in the hypothesis, leaving it unclear if the focus is the same.
5. "Gathered at night" does not provide enough context to ensure they are all looking at the event mentioned in the premise.
