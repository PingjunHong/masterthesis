- Running and walking are distinct actions, and the premise only mentions running.
- The premise does not provide any information about the dog walking, only about it running.
- There is no indication in the premise that the dog is walking, only that it is running.
- The premise lacks evidence to support the dog walking, as it specifically states the dog is running.
- Walking is not mentioned in the premise, which exclusively describes the dog running.
- The premise specifies running, which is not synonymous with walking, leading to a contradiction.
