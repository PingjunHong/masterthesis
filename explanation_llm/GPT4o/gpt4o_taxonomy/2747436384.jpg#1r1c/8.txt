1. Waves that are approaching and about to hit typically do not miss their target unless there is an external factor that changes their trajectory.
2. Given the predictable nature of wave movement, an approaching wave that is about to hit is unlikely to miss without significant environmental changes.
3. The expectation from the premise is that the wave will make contact with the boys, so saying it missed directly contradicts this outcome.
4. Real-world physics suggests that once a wave is close enough to be about to hit, it is improbable for it to miss without other influences.
5. The boys being in the path of an approaching wave implies the likelihood of impact, contradicting the notion of the wave missing them.
6. In typical scenarios, waves follow a consistent path towards shore, suggesting that a near wave would not miss unless obstructed.
7. Natural wave dynamics mean that an approaching wave about to hit is very likely to follow through with the impact, making a miss contradictory.
8. Without intervention or an unexpected event, an approaching wave will generally continue its path and hit the intended target.
9. The phrase 'about to be hit' strongly implies imminent contact, thus the concept of the wave missing is logically inconsistent.
10. Based on common beach experiences, waves that are close enough to be about to hit often do not miss, contradicting the statement.
