1. If the wave is approaching the boys, it implies the wave is moving towards them, which contradicts the claim that the wave missed the boys.
2. The premise indicates imminent contact between the wave and the boys, suggesting that the wave will hit them, not miss them.
3. The term "about to be hit" denotes an impending impact, which logically conflicts with the statement that the impact did not occur.
4. "Approaching wave" implies a trajectory that leads towards the boys, contradicting the assertion that the wave missed them.
5. The phrase "about to be hit" suggests the wave will make contact, which contradicts the statement that the boys were unharmed by the wave.
6. The structure of the premise implies a future event where the wave will collide with the boys, conflicting with the hypothesis that no collision occurred.
7. The semantic implication of "approaching" in the premise suggests an inevitable encounter, which contradicts the hypothesis of a missed encounter.
8. The premise presents a scenario where the boys are positioned in the path of the wave, contradicting the statement that the wave did not reach them.
