2. "Four boys are about to be hit by an approaching wave" indicates that contact between the wave and the boys is imminent, contrasting with "The wave missed the boys," which means no contact occurred.
3. The phrase "are about to be hit" suggests an impending impact, which is in direct contradiction to "missed," indicating no impact occurred.
4. The premise describes a situation where contact is expected ("about to be hit"), while the statement describes a situation where contact was avoided ("missed").
5. "The wave missed the boys" structurally negates the anticipated outcome in "Four boys are about to be hit by an approaching wave."
6. "Missed the boys" conveys an outcome where the wave fails to connect, whereas "about to be hit" conveys a situation where the connection is expected to occur.
7. The premise sets up a scenario of impending contact, while the statement describes an outcome where contact did not happen, which are structurally contradictory.
8. "About to be hit" suggests a future event that is likely to happen soon, while "missed" suggests a past event that did not occur, creating a contradiction in expectations and outcomes.
