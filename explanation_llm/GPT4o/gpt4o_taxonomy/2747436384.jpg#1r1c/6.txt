1. If the wave is approaching, it cannot have missed the boys.
2. An approaching wave implies imminent contact, contradicting the idea that it missed the boys.
3. The condition of "being hit" conflicts with the claim that the wave missed them.
4. The premise indicates a direct threat from the wave, which is logically exclusive to the wave missing them.
5. The temporal sequence of "about to be hit" conflicts with the outcome of the wave missing the boys.
6. The spatial proximity suggested by "approaching" contradicts the possibility of the wave missing them.
7. The premise suggests unavoidable impact, which is logically exclusive to avoidance or missing.
8. The structural expectation of "being hit" versus "missed" creates a contradiction in logical outcomes.
