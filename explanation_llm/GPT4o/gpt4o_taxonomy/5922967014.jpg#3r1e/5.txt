- The premise mentions the boys are enjoying a day at the beach, but does not explicitly state they are physically on the beach.
- The premise could imply that the boys are near the beach or at a location associated with the beach, such as a beachside park or a nearby caf√©, without being directly on the sand.
- The boys could be enjoying the beach from a distance, such as from a balcony or boardwalk, where they can see the beach but are not on it.
- The premise does not specify the boys' exact location, leaving open the possibility that they are in a place adjacent to the beach, like a beach club or hotel.
- The premise lacks mention of the boys' actual position relative to the beach, so the hypothesis assumes information not specifically provided by the premise.
- There is no direct mention in the premise of the boys being on the beach sand itself; they could be on a boat or in the water near the beach.
