1. "Three men" implies three males, but the premise only mentions two guys.
2. The premise includes only two males, which conflicts with the statement's mention of three men.
3. The hypothesis assumes the presence of three men, while the premise confirms only two guys.
4. A count of two males in the premise cannot accommodate the three men suggested in the statement.
5. There is a numerical discrepancy between the two guys in the premise and the three men in the statement.
6. The statement's requirement of three men is logically exclusive given the premise's mention of only two guys.
7. The premise restricts the male count to two, contradicting the statement's implication of three.
8. The hypothesis introduces an additional man not accounted for in the premise's count of two guys.
9. The contradiction arises from the statement needing three men, which exceeds the two guys in the premise.
10. Structural exclusivity is evident as the premise's two guys cannot logically fulfill the statement's three men condition.
