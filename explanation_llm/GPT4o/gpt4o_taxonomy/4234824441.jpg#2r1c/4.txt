3. The quantity of men mentioned in the hypothesis exceeds the number specified in the premise, resulting in a logical inconsistency.
4. The premise provides a count of two guys, but the hypothesis incorrectly refers to three men, leading to a contradiction.
5. The hypothesis assumes the presence of three men, which is logically impossible given the premise's count of two guys.
