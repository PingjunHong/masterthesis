1. The premise describes people standing on a pier, but it does not mention any fishing activity.
2. The statement suggests an activity (going fishing) not explicitly stated or implied by people simply standing on a pier.
3. Standing on a pier does not inherently mean they are going fishing, as the premise lacks details about fishing equipment or actions.
4. The premise and the statement involve different actions; standing is not equivalent to going fishing.
5. The structural setup of the premise does not include any mention or rephrasing related to fishing activities.
6. The premise's description of the scene with a table and glasses does not structurally imply fishing.
7. The hypothesis introduces a new activity not syntactically rephrased or reorganized from the premise.
8. The scene described in the premise could imply various activities, and fishing is just one of many possibilities not directly related to the structure of the premise.
