1. The premise does not mention the activities the people on the pier are engaged in, so we cannot assume they are going fishing.
2. The presence of a table and a pair of glasses does not provide evidence that the people are preparing to fish.
3. The premise describes people standing on a pier but does not specify their intentions or activities, leaving the possibility of fishing open but unsupported.
4. There is no indication in the premise that any fishing equipment, such as rods or bait, is present, so fishing is only one of many possible activities.
5. The premise merely describes people standing on a pier, which could be for various reasons unrelated to fishing, like sightseeing or socializing.
6. The hypothesis introduces the idea of fishing, but the premise lacks any specific details to confirm or deny this activity.
7. The hypothesis assumes an activity that is not explicitly mentioned or implied by the setting described in the premise.
8. The hypothesis suggests a specific action, fishing, which is not supported by any observable actions or objects in the premise.
9. The assumption that they are going fishing is speculative, as the premise does not provide any direct evidence for this activity.
10. The hypothesis involves an activity that could be plausible given the setting but is not confirmed by any details in the premise.
