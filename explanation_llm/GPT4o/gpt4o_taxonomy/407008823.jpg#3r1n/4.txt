1. The premise discusses people jumping over a mountain crevasse using a rope but provides no information about their emotions or facial expressions.
2. There is no explicit mention or description of fear in the premise; therefore, the hypothesis about people looking afraid cannot be logically inferred.
3. The visual appearance or emotional state of the people jumping is not addressed in the premise, leaving the hypothesis about their fear unsupported.
4. The act of jumping over a crevasse using a rope does not inherently imply any emotional state such as fear, making the hypothesis neutral.
5. The premise does not contain any words or phrases that suggest an emotional response, such as fear, which is the focus of the hypothesis.
6. While the action described (jumping over a crevasse) could be associated with fear, the premise does not explicitly state this, so the hypothesis remains neutral.
7. The premise describes an action but lacks any semantic cues that would lead to a conclusion about the emotional reactions of the people involved.
8. The hypothesis introduces the idea of fear, which is not logically embedded within the structure or semantics of the premise itself.
9. The premise's focus is solely on the physical action of jumping, without any logical implications regarding the jumpers' feelings or mental states.
10. The hypothesis makes an assumption about people's visual appearance that is not covered by the details provided in the premise.
