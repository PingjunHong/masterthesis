1. "Some" does not specify how many, so it is unclear if those afraid are part of the people jumping.
2. The premise does not indicate any emotions or expressions, so it is uncertain if anyone appears afraid.
3. The statement suggests some people might be afraid, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this.
4. The premise describes a physical action, while the statement implies an emotional state, resulting in no direct logical conflict.
5. The term "some people" does not conflict with the unspecified number of people jumping.
6. The premise lacks details on individualsâ€™ reactions, making the statement about fear neither confirmed nor contradicted.
7. The potential fear in the statement is not directly addressed in the premise, allowing room for both scenarios to coexist.
8. The premise does not specify the total number of people or their emotions, so the statement remains ambiguous in context.
9. The premise does not mention anything about fear, leaving the possibility of fear open without contradiction.
10. The statement's implication of fear is not inherently exclusive to the action described in the premise.
