3. The premise lacks a temporal component to confirm a trip is occurring or planned at that moment.
4. There is no information in the premise about the carâ€™s movement, so it might still be stationary or parked.
5. The premise does not mention any travel-related activities or destinations that are typically associated with a trip.
