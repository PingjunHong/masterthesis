- "Land rover" and "sedan" refer to different types of vehicles, implying a contradiction in vehicle type.
- "Being driven across" suggests movement and successful traversal, while "stuck in the middle" suggests immobility and failure to cross.
- "Across a river" indicates a successful passage, whereas "in the middle of a river" implies being stationary and obstructed.
- "Land rover" is typically associated with off-road capability suitable for driving through rivers, while a "sedan" is generally not suited for such terrain, leading to a contradiction in vehicle suitability.
