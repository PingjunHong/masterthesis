1. A land rover and a sedan are distinct types of vehicles, meaning a land rover cannot be a sedan simultaneously.
2. Being driven across implies successful movement from one side to the other, contradicting the notion of being stuck.
3. "Across a river" suggests traversal and continuity, whereas "in the middle of a river" implies a halt, creating a contradiction.
4. The action "being driven" indicates active control and progress, conflicting with "stuck," which indicates immobility.
5. The premise describes a scenario of successful navigation, which directly opposes the scenario of immobilization described in the hypothesis.
