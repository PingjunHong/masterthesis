1. The description "a goofy looking woman" in the premise does not specify the woman's hair color, whereas the hypothesis mentions "a blonde woman," leaving room for ambiguity.
2. The premise mentions "singing on stage," but the hypothesis adds "and dancing," which is not addressed in the premise.
3. The term "goofy looking" in the premise does not indicate hair color, and thus it is unclear if it refers to the "blonde woman" in the hypothesis.
4. The reference to "on stage" in both statements is consistent, but the additional action of "dancing" in the hypothesis is not mentioned in the premise.
5. The premise and hypothesis both involve a woman singing, but the coreference to "goofy looking" versus "blonde" is unresolved.
6. "A goofy looking woman" lacks specific identifiers that connect to the "blonde woman" in the hypothesis.
