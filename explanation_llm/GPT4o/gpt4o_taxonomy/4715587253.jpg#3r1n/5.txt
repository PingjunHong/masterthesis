1. The premise does not specify the hair color of the woman, so we cannot conclude that she is blonde.
2. The premise mentions only singing, not dancing, so we cannot assume she is also dancing.
3. The woman's appearance being described as "goofy looking" in the premise does not confirm her being blonde in the hypothesis.
4. There is no information in the premise about the woman performing any actions other than singing.
5. The premise lacks any mention of the specific characteristics of the stage performance beyond singing.
6. The hypothesis includes additional details about dancing, which are not mentioned in the premise.
7. The premise does not exclude the possibility of the woman being blonde, but it does not confirm it either.
8. The premise only confirms the presence of a woman singing, without providing details about her hair color or other activities.
9. The absence of mention of dancing in the premise makes it impossible to support the hypothesis fully.
10. The hypothesis introduces new information about the woman's appearance and actions that the premise does not address.
