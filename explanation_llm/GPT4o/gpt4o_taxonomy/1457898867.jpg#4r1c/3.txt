1. "A boy is riding down the road between two cows" syntactically implies the presence of two cows, whereas "A single cow is alone" implies the presence of only one cow.
2. The structure of "A boy is riding down the road between two cows" conveys that the cows are not alone, contradicting the statement "A single cow is alone."
3. "Between two cows" indicates the presence of multiple cows, which structurally contradicts "A single cow is alone."
4. The phrase "two cows" in the premise indicates plurality, while "single cow" in the hypothesis indicates singularity, creating a contradiction.
5. The premise uses "between," implying more than one cow, whereas the hypothesis uses "alone," implying one cow, resulting in a structural contradiction.
6. "Two cows" in the premise structurally opposes "single" in the hypothesis, making the hypothesis contradictory.
7. The phrase "A single cow is alone" structurally conflicts with "A boy is riding down the road between two cows," as the premise explicitly mentions two cows.
8. The syntactic structure "between two cows" inherently contradicts the hypothesis's "alone" structure.
