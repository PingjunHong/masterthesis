1. If a boy is riding between two cows, then there are at least two cows present, contradicting the idea of a single cow being alone.
2. The presence of two cows implies that no single cow is alone, as there are at least two cows together.
3. Two cows being present means that no cow can be considered alone, as they are in the company of each other.
4. The statement that a single cow is alone conflicts with the premise because the premise explicitly states the presence of two cows.
5. Riding between two cows indicates that the cows are not isolated; hence, the notion of a single cow being alone is false.
6. The count of cows in the premise is two, which negates the possibility of just one cow being alone.
7. The existence of two cows inherently means neither cow can be alone, as defined by the statement.
8. The phrase "between two cows" logically excludes the scenario of a single cow being alone, given the plural number of cows.
