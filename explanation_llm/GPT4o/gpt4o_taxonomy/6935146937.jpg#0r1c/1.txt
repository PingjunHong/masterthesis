- "Green shoes" on the basketball player are not mentioned in the context of making a sandwich, suggesting the subjects should be the same person.
- The expressions "looks on" and "gasps in awe" both pertain to the crowd's reaction, but they do not align with the described actions of the subject.
- "A basketball player" implies an athletic context conflicting with "making a sandwich," which is not an athletic action.

- "Dunking the ball" inherently involves basketball and athletic skill, conflicting with the domestic and non-athletic act of "making a sandwich."
- The crowd's reaction described as "looks on" in the premise is passive, while "gasps in awe" suggests a dramatic response, which is inconsistent with the given actions and settings.
