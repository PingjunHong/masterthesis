3. The environmental context of a bar is more commonly associated with billiards rather than checkers, which is usually played in quieter, more casual settings.
4. The physical actions required for billiards, such as striking balls with a cue stick, are incompatible with the actions needed to play checkers, which involve moving pieces by hand.
5. Billiards requires a billiard table, which is not suitable for playing checkers, as checkers requires a flat board with squares for moving pieces.
6. The skill set and focus required for billiards differ significantly from those needed for checkers, as billiards involves aiming and striking, while checkers involves strategic planning and moving pieces.
7. Cultural associations and social activities at bars typically involve games like billiards or pool, not checkers, which is less commonly played in such settings.
8. The presence of billiard equipment in the premise suggests that the man is engaged in billiards, not checkers, which requires entirely different equipment.
