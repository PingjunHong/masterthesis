1. The phrase "the man wearing the vest" in the statement does not specify the color of the vest, whereas the premise specifies a "red vest," leaving ambiguity in the reference.
2. The statement mentions "walking down the street," which is not directly referenced in the premise, creating uncertainty about whether "walking past a black and green fence" implies the same location.
3. The statement uses "the man wearing the vest," which could refer to any vest-wearing man, not necessarily the one specified in the premise as wearing a red vest, resulting in a neutral relationship.
4. The reference to "the man wearing the vest" does not resolve the specific details provided in the premise, such as the colors of the fence, leading to neutrality.
5. The premise includes a specific location detail ("past a black and green fence"), while the statement is vague about the location, creating a lack of specific coreference.
