1. The premise does not mention any protest activity, so the action described in the hypothesis is not confirmed.
2. The hypothesis implies a specific intention (protesting) that is not explicitly or implicitly supported by the premise.
3. The premise describes a physical posture (kneeling), which does not necessarily indicate the activity of protesting.
4. The context of simply being in the street, as described in the premise, does not inherently suggest a protest.
5. The hypothesis introduces a new action (protesting) that is not logically necessitated by the act of kneeling in the premise.
6. The premise provides no information about the woman's motivations or actions that would confirm a protest.
7. The hypothesis assumes a specific social activity (protesting) without any evidence from the premise.
