- "A person" in the hypothesis refers to the same individual mentioned in the premise, but their location and activity contradict each other.

- Both "a person" in the premise and hypothesis refer to the same person; however, the described locations ("in front of a graffiti covered wall" vs. "at home") contradict each other.
- The pronoun "a person" is coreferential in both statements, but the premise describes them as "sitting" while the hypothesis describes them as "laying," which presents a contradiction in action and setting.
- The same individual is referred to by "a person" in both the premise and hypothesis, yet the premise places them outdoors, while the hypothesis places them indoors, leading to a contradiction.
