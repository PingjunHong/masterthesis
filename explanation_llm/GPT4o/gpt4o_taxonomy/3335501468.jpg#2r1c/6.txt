- A bird cannot be both flapping its wings on the water and flying over the trees at the same time.
- Flapping wings on the water implies being on or near the water, whereas flying over the trees implies being in the air above trees, creating a location conflict.
- The action of flapping wings on the water suggests the bird is not airborne, contradicting the claim that it is flying.
- Being on the water and being over the trees are mutually exclusive locations.
- The premise suggests a water-based activity, while the hypothesis suggests a land-based activity, leading to a logical structural exclusivity conflict in location.
- Flapping wings on the water and flying over trees cannot simultaneously occur due to spatial limitations.
