1. Birds cannot fly over trees while they are flapping their wings on the water.
2. Being on water and flying over trees are mutually exclusive actions for a bird.
3. A bird flapping its wings on water indicates it is either swimming or taking off, not flying over trees.
4. Birds need to be airborne to fly over trees, which contradicts being on water.
5. The action of a bird flapping its wings on water does not align with the altitude required to fly over trees.
6. Flapping wings on water involves different physical positions and movements than flying over trees.
7. The context of being on water implies the bird is at a lower elevation than necessary to fly over trees.
8. A bird cannot simultaneously be on water and over trees due to the spatial separation.
9. The statement that the bird is flying over trees ignores the physical presence and limitation of being on water.
10. Flapping wings on water suggests preparation for flight or floating, not the act of soaring over trees.
