1. Flapping wings on water implies the bird is not airborne, contradicting flying over trees.
2. Being on the water suggests the bird is at a lower altitude, incompatible with being above trees.
3. The action of flapping wings on water indicates the bird's location is on the water, not over the trees.
4. The bird's interaction with the water implies proximity to the water surface, opposing the notion of being airborne over trees.
5. The act of flapping wings on water suggests the bird is in contact with the water, which contradicts being in the air above trees.
6. Presence on water negates the possibility of simultaneous presence above trees.
7. Flapping wings while on water implies a state of floating or swimming, not flying over trees.
8. The bird's current activity involves water surface interaction, incompatible with tree canopy altitude.
