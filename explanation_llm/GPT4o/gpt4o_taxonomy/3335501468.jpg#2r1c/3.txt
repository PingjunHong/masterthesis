1. Flapping its wings on the water implies the bird is on or near the water, not above trees.
2. Flying over the trees suggests being airborne above tree level, which contradicts being on the water.
3. The bird's action of flapping its wings on the water indicates it is not in the air, which contradicts flying over the trees.
4. Wings flapping on the water describes the bird's location as on or at the surface of the water, not in flight above trees.
5. The bird is positioned on the water when flapping its wings, contradicting the location of flying over the trees.
6. A bird flapping its wings on the water cannot simultaneously be flying over trees, as both actions denote different positions.
7. Being on the water and flying over trees are mutually exclusive locations, leading to a contradiction.
8. The structural implication of being on the water negates the possibility of simultaneously being above the trees.
9. The premise describes an action on the water surface, while the hypothesis describes an action in the air, creating a contradiction.
10. The bird's activity on the water surface cannot coexist with being airborne above trees.
