1. The premise mentions that the choir sings joyous songs, but it doesn't explicitly indicate that the entire church is filled with song.
2. While the choir is singing, there is no mention of the effect of their singing on the whole church environment.
3. The premise does not specify that the singing fills the church or reaches all areas inside the church.
4. Although singing occurs, there is no evidence that the sound permeates the entire space of the church.
5. The premise focuses on the choir's activity but does not provide information about the acoustics or sound distribution in the church.
6. The statement that the church is filled with song assumes a broader impact of the choir's singing, which is not confirmed by the premise.
7. The premise lacks any mention of the volume or reach of the singing, which is necessary to assume the church is filled with song.
8. The choir's singing might be localized, and the premise does not clarify whether it resonates throughout the church.
9. The presence of joyous songs does not inherently entail that the church itself is filled with song.
10. The premise does not include details on the number of choir members or the size of the church, which would help assess whether the church is filled with song.
11. It is not specified whether the choir's singing is heard by everyone in the church, which would support the hypothesis.
12. The hypothesis assumes an atmosphere of song within the church, but the premise does not explicitly mention such an atmosphere.
