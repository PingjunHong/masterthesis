1. "Three firefighters playing cards inside a fire station" rephrases the premise by changing the location from a subway station to a fire station, which results in a contradiction since the locations differ.
2. The premise states that the firefighters are coming out of a subway station, while the hypothesis rephrases this to imply their location is inside a fire station, contradicting the external location in the premise.
3. The structural shift from "coming out of a subway station" to "playing cards inside a fire station" alters the meaning by changing the activity and location, resulting in a contradiction.
4. "Inside a fire station" contradicts "out of a subway station" as a rephrased location change from exterior to interior, leading to a contradiction.
5. The rephrased hypothesis suggests firefighters are stationary and engaged in an indoor activity, whereas the premise describes them exiting a subway station, contradicting each other.
6. The hypothesis rephrases the premise's location and activity, changing it from exiting a subway station to playing cards inside a fire station, which contradicts the original situation.
7. "Playing cards inside a fire station" contradicts "come out of subway station" through rephrasing that changes both location and activity, resulting in a contradiction.
8. The rephrasing that alters "subway station" to "fire station" and introduces "playing cards" contradicts the premise's description of location and movement.
