1. The premise does not specify whether the puppies are its own, whereas the hypothesis implies they belong to another dog.
2. The premise allows for any puppies to be nursed, but the hypothesis restricts them to being puppies of another dog.
3. The premise is neutral about the ownership of the puppies, whereas the hypothesis introduces exclusivity regarding the puppies' parentage.
4. There is no explicit mention of ownership in the premise, leading to a logical structure conflict with the hypothesis's claim of other dogs' puppies.
5. The premise does not provide information on whether the puppies are biologically related to the golden retriever, while the hypothesis does.
6. The hypothesis introduces the idea of nursing other dogs' puppies, which is not necessarily supported or contradicted by the premise.
7. The premise does not specify that the golden retriever nurses exclusively puppies of other dogs, creating a structural logical conflict with the hypothesis.
