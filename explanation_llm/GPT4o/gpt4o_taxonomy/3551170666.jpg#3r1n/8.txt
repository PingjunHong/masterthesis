- Golden retrievers can nurse puppies that are not their own, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm this scenario.
- The act of nursing puppies is not exclusively limited to a dog’s own offspring; the premise does not clarify this aspect.
- The premise does not include details about the lineage of the puppies, leaving the possibility open but unconfirmed.
- Without further context, it is just as plausible that the puppies belong to the golden retriever as it is that they belong to another dog.
- The premise simply states the action of nursing without indicating any relationship or ownership between the golden retriever and the puppies.
- Real-world situations allow for dogs to nurse puppies regardless of biological connection, and the premise does not specify either situation.
- The information given does not preclude the possibility that the puppies are the golden retriever's own, making the hypothesis speculative.
- The scenario described could involve the golden retriever’s own puppies or others, and the premise does not dictate one over the other.
