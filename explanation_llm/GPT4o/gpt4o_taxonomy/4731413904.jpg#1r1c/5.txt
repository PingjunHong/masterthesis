1. The premise states that the men are watching a sports game on television, but it does not specify what type of sports game it is, so it might not be a baseball game.
2. There is no information in the premise indicating that the men have left the bar to physically attend a baseball game.
3. The premise only mentions the men watching a sports game on television, which does not confirm their attendance at any sports event, including a baseball game.
4. The premise does not mention the men being present at a baseball game, only that they are in a bar, which contradicts the statement.
5. The premise lacks any detail suggesting the men are at a venue where a baseball game is being played.
6. Watching a sports game on television does not imply that the men are physically at the location of the game itself.
7. The premise indicates their physical location is a bar, not a baseball stadium or field.
8. There is no mention in the premise of any elements that are typically associated with being at a baseball game, such as a stadium, field, or live audience.
9. The setting described in the premise is indoors at a bar, whereas being at a baseball game would imply an outdoor or stadium setting.
10. The premise does not provide any evidence that the sports game being watched is baseball, so assuming they are at a baseball game introduces unsupported information.
