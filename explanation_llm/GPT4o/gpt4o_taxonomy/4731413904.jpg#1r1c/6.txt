1. The location of the men is a bar, not a baseball game.
2. Watching a sports game on television does not imply attending the game in person.
3. The location conflict arises because a bar is a distinct place from a baseball game venue.
4. The men observing the game via television indicates they are not physically present at the baseball game.
5. The contradiction stems from the distinct settings: one being an indoor establishment and the other an outdoor event.
6. The logical exclusivity of being either at a bar or at a baseball game highlights the contradiction.
7. The activity described involves watching on television, which does not equate to being at the game itself.
