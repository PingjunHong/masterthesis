4. The action of watching on television suggests distance from the actual event, contradicting the statement of being at the game.
5. The term "bar" implies a drinking establishment, not a sports venue like a baseball stadium.
6. "Watching" implies a spectator activity from afar, not direct participation or presence at the event.
7. The word "television" indicates a broadcast medium, not a live attendance at a baseball game.
8. The setting described in the premise is a bar, which does not match the sports venue implied by "baseball game."
