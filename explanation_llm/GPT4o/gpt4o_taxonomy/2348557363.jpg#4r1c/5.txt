- The premise mentions library steps, but does not mention school steps, so there is no evidence the child is at a school.
- The location of the library steps does not imply or suggest that they are part of a school, thus contradicting the idea that the child is on the school steps.
- The premise does not provide information indicating that the library is within a school, therefore, the claim about school steps is unsupported.
- There is no mention in the premise that the library is associated with a school, thus the hypothesis introduces unsupported information.
- The premise specifies a library as the location, and there is no mention of a school, leading to the conclusion that the steps are not part of a school.
- The hypothesis assumes a different location than the one explicitly stated in the premise, which lacks evidence for the presence of school steps.
