1. Libraries and schools are distinct locations with different functions, so being on library steps means the child is not on school steps.
2. Libraries and schools are usually separate buildings, so the child cannot be simultaneously on the steps of both.
3. The architectural design of library steps and school steps typically differ, making it unlikely they're the same.
4. Libraries and schools generally serve different purposes and are situated in separate places, so the child can't be at both at once.
5. The physical location of a library is typically different from that of a school, indicating the child is not in the same place as stated.
6. Libraries and schools cater to different activities and needs; therefore, their entrances, including steps, are located in different areas.
7. The context of being on library steps inherently suggests the child is not at a school, given the distinct nature of these places.
8. Libraries often have specific architectural features that differ from those of schools, making the two sets of steps distinct.
9. The association of library steps with a library environment suggests that the child is not in a school environment.
10. Libraries and schools are distinct entities, usually located in different places, thus preventing concurrent presence on both steps.
11. A library and a school are separate institutions, so it's improbable for the steps of one to be confused with the steps of the other.
12. The childâ€™s location on library steps indicates a setting connected to reading and study, not education and classrooms like a school.
13. Libraries and schools often have different geographic locations within a community, making it impossible for the child to be on both steps at once.
14. Library steps suggest an association with borrowing books or quiet study, unlike school steps, which are related to education and learning.
15. The intended use and setting of library steps differ from school steps, precluding the possibility of them being the same location.
