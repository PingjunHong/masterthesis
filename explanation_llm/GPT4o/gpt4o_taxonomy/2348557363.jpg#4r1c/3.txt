1. "The child is on the school steps" contradicts "This child is on the library steps" because "school steps" and "library steps" refer to different locations.
2. "This child is on the library steps" and "The child is on the school steps" are structurally similar but refer to different places, making them contradictory.
3. "On the library steps" and "on the school steps" cannot simultaneously describe the same location, leading to a contradiction.
4. The rephrasing of "This child is on the library steps" as "The child is on the school steps" changes the location from "library" to "school," creating a contradiction.
5. The structure of both statements is the same, but the specific locations "library" and "school" are different, resulting in a contradiction.
6. "The child" in both statements refers to the same individual, but the locations described are not the same; "library steps" versus "school steps" are inconsistent.
7. The contradiction arises from the rephrased structural similarity where "library steps" is altered to "school steps," changing the meaning entirely.
8. Despite the syntactic similarity, the premises refer to distinct locations ("library" versus "school"), leading to a contradiction.
