1. "Some" implies at least one person, and three girls satisfy this condition.
2. The premise involves multiple individuals, aligning with the quantifier "some" in the statement.
3. Quantifier "some" is consistent, as there are three individuals involved in the action.
4. There is no temporal conflict; both premise and statement occur simultaneously.
5. Location conflict is absent as both actions occur at the same place (around a cake).
6. Gender is irrelevant to the quantifier "some," which includes any gender.
7. The premise specifies girls, which are people, fulfilling the requirement of "some people."
8. No logical structure exclusivity, as "some" does not conflict with three individuals.
9. "Some people" is structurally inclusive, matching the scenario of three individuals.
10. There is no exclusivity conflict between "some" and the number three.
11. The action described (blowing out candles) is temporally aligned in both premise and statement.
12. "Some people" is sufficiently vague, allowing for three individuals without contradiction.
13. The number "three" inherently satisfies the non-exclusivity of "some."
14. The fact that "some" includes at least one person aligns with the premise of three girls.
15. The structural logic of "some" accommodates the premiseâ€™s depiction of multiple participants.
