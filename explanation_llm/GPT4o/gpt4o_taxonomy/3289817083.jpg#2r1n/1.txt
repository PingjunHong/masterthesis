- The hypothesis assumes the baby is the man's daughter, but the premise does not specify the relationship between the man and the baby.
- The premise does not confirm the gender or relationship of the baby with the man, leaving "daughter" unresolved.
- "His daughter" implies a familial relationship that is not established by the premise's description of "a baby."
- The hypothesis involves an assumption about the identity or relationship of the individuals not specified in the premise.
