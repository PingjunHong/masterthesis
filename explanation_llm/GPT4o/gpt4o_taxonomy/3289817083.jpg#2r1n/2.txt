1. The word "baby" does not specifically indicate the gender, so it is unclear if the baby is a daughter.
2. The premise does not specify any relationship between the man and the baby, so it is uncertain if the baby is his daughter.
3. The word "holding" does not imply that the baby is actively petting the pony, unlike the statement which implies both are petting the pony.
4. The premise does not confirm that the man is related to the baby, whereas the statement assumes a familial relationship.
5. The use of "his daughter" in the statement introduces an assumption not supported by the premise.
6. The premise describes a baby, which does not necessarily mean the child is old enough to be identified as petting the pony.
7. The premise focuses on the action of holding, while the statement suggests both the man and the child are directly interacting with the pony.
8. The semantic difference between "baby" and "daughter" introduces ambiguity regarding the child's identity in relation to the man.
9. The term "petting" in the statement implies active participation, which may not be consistent with the baby's possible actions described in the premise.
10. The premise does not imply any specific familial bond between the man and the baby, leaving the relationship ambiguous.
