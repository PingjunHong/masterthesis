1. The premise does not provide information about the gender or identity of the baby, so it is unknown whether the baby is the man's daughter.
2. The premise specifies that it is the baby, not the man, who is petting the pony, so the statement about both the man and his daughter petting the pony is not directly supported.
3. The premise does not indicate any interaction between the man and the pony, focusing instead on the baby’s action.
4. The hypothesis introduces the relationship of "daughter," which is not addressed by the premise, leaving the familial connection unestablished.
5. The premise mentions a baby, which is a more general term than "daughter," leading to ambiguity about the baby's identity.
6. The premise and the statement are focused on different subjects concerning the action of petting the pony, with the premise focusing on the baby's action alone.
7. The semantic structure of the premise centers on the baby’s interaction with the pony, not on the man's involvement or relationship with the baby.
8. The hypothesis assumes a specific relationship between the man and the baby, which is not logically implied or confirmed by the premise.
9. The premise lacks explicit mention of any shared activity between the man and the baby, specifically in terms of petting the pony together.
