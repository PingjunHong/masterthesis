- The premise indicates that a person is actively rolling down the hill, which contradicts the hypothesis that the hill is empty.
- An occupied hill with a person riding a wagon is incompatible with the notion of the hill being empty.
- The presence of two people on the hill—one riding a wagon and another watching—contradicts the hypothesis of the hill being empty.
- Real-world observation suggests that when someone is rolling down a hill in a wagon, the hill cannot be considered empty.
- The action of rolling down the hill implies the hill is occupied, contradicting the claim of emptiness.
- The premise describes activity and presence on the hill, making it impossible for the hill to be empty as stated in the hypothesis.
- If a person is engaged in an activity on the hill, such as wagon riding, it logically cannot be described as an empty hill.
- The assumption that an empty hill exists is contradicted by the observable event of a person riding a wagon on it.
