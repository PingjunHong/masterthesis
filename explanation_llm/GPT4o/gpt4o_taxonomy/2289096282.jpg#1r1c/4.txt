1. If a person is rolling down a hill in a wagon, then the hill is not empty because it contains both the person and the wagon.
2. An empty hill implies there are no people or objects on it, contradicting the presence of a person and a wagon rolling down the hill.
3. The presence of a person in a wagon on the hill negates the possibility of the hill being empty as stated in the hypothesis.
4. The act of another person watching someone roll down the hill suggests there is activity on the hill, contradicting the idea that the hill is empty.
5. If the hill were empty, there would be neither a person rolling down nor another person watching, both of which are present in the premise.
6. The premise describes two people and a wagon on the hill, conflicting with the statement that the hill is empty, as "empty" implies no people or objects.
7. The concept of "rolling down" requires a person and a vehicle (wagon) to be on the hill, directly opposing the claim of an empty hill.
8. The presence of observers and participants in an activity on the hill indicates it is not empty, as claimed by the hypothesis.
