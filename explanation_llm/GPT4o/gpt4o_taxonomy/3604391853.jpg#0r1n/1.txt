1. The man in a red shirt refers to the man reaching out to another person.
2. His wife is an unspecified person, and there is no indication in the premise that the person being reached for is his wife.
3. The person the man is reaching for is not identified as his wife in the premise.
4. The reference to "his wife" cannot be resolved using the information provided in the premise.
5. The premise does not specify the relationship between the man and the person he is reaching out to, so "his wife" is not a resolvable reference.
6. The hypothesis introduces "his wife," which is not mentioned or implied in the premise.
7. The premise only describes one person reaching for another without specifying any familial or marital relationship.
8. There is no coreferential link between "another person" in the premise and "his wife" in the hypothesis.
9. The identity of "another person" in the premise is not established, so it cannot be confirmed as "his wife."
10. Without further context, the hypothesis's use of "his wife" remains unsupported by the premise.
