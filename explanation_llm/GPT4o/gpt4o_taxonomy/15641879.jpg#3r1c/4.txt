1. A sweatshirt is a type of clothing that typically covers the upper body and arms, while a tank top is sleeveless, so it is not possible for the man to be wearing both at the same time.
2. The structure of the premise indicates that the man is wearing an Alaska sweatshirt, which logically implies he is not wearing a tank top simultaneously.
3. The premise describes the man as wearing a sweatshirt, which contradicts the hypothesis that he is wearing a tank top due to the inherent difference in clothing types.
4. A sweatshirt by definition covers the upper body more fully than a tank top, making it logically inconsistent for both to be worn at the same time.
5. The semantic meaning of "sweatshirt" indicates long sleeves and full coverage, which pragmatically excludes the possibility of wearing a tank top.
