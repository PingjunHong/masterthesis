1. "Woman" and "women" refer to different quantities; "woman" is singular, while "women" is plural.
2. The group consists of multiple "students," which aligns with the plural "women," not the singular "woman."
3. The structural difference between "female students" and "woman students" suggests a conflict in logical quantity.
4. The singular "woman" conflicts with the plural context implied by "group of young dark-haired female students."
5. The use of "woman" indicates a single individual, contradicting the premise's description of a group interaction.
6. The phrase "group of young dark-haired female students" logically excludes the possibility of referring to them collectively as "a woman."
7. "Woman" implies only one individual, while "group" inherently means more than one, creating a logical exclusivity.
8. The plural "students" supports the plural "women" and conflicts with the singular "woman."
9. The premise describes interaction with a group, which is incompatible with the singular form "woman" in the hypothesis.
10. The logical structure of the premise implies multiple individuals, conflicting with the singular form used in the hypothesis.
