1. The description of the plants as "surrounding the white pole" does not provide enough information to determine the specific type of plants.
2. The term "plants" is too broad and does not specify any particular type, such as ferns.
3. The activity of protecting plants does not necessarily imply that the plants are ferns.
4. Without visual or specific descriptive details about the plants' characteristics, we cannot conclude they are ferns.
5. There are many types of plants that could be surrounding the white pole, and ferns are just one possibility among many.
6. The presence of young adults working together does not provide any clues or evidence regarding the specific type of plants.
7. The assumption that the plants are ferns requires additional information not provided in the premise.
8. The premise does not mention any distinguishing features of ferns, making the hypothesis speculative.
9. The context of protecting plants does not inherently suggest any particular species, including ferns.
10. Without explicit mention or evidence of characteristics unique to ferns, the hypothesis remains unsubstantiated.
