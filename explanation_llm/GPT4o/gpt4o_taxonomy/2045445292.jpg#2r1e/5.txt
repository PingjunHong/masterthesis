1. The premise does not specify whether the men are currently working, only that they work, so the statement that they are working could be true.
2. The premise mentions men working with a log, but does not explicitly confirm they are working right now, leaving the statement inconclusive.
3. The content implies activity but does not provide real-time confirmation, so the statement could be accurate but is not confirmed.
4. The premise indicates an ongoing task but lacks explicit temporal markers to confirm the current action described in the statement.
5. The premise gives a general description of the task without specifying the exact moment, so it's possible the statement is true but not directly supported.
6. The premise does not mention the current state of the action, leaving the possibility open for the statement to be true without explicit evidence.
7. The premise provides context for the activity but does not confirm the timing, so the statement might be true but isn't definitively entailed by the premise.
8. It's unclear if the activity is happening at the moment from the premise, allowing for the statement to be true but not explicitly supported.
9. The premise discusses the action but doesn't specify "when," making the statement potentially true but not conclusively entailed.
10. The action described in the premise is not limited to the present moment, so the statement might align with the premise but lacks direct evidence.
