1. Quantifier conflict: "Two" in the premise matches "two" in the hypothesis, supporting the entailment.
2. Temporal consistency: "Work" and "are working" indicate ongoing action in both statements.
3. Structural exclusivity: The premise specifies "two strong men," and the hypothesis uses the same structure, confirming no additional individuals are involved.
4. Logical consistency: The premise and hypothesis both describe actions by the same two men, maintaining logical coherence.
5. Location consistency: Both statements imply the same setting where the men are working, supporting entailment.
