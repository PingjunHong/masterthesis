1. The phrase "getting drunk at a house party" does not specify that people are holding beers, only that they are consuming alcohol, which could be in various forms, not necessarily beer.
2. The premise describes a general scene of a house party with people getting drunk, but does not explicitly state the presence of beers, allowing for the possibility of other alcoholic beverages.
3. The structure of "people getting drunk" implies alcohol consumption but does not inherently convey the specific action of holding beers as described in the hypothesis.
4. "Getting drunk at a house party" could involve various drinking scenarios, none of which are explicitly detailed in the premise, leaving the hypothesis about holding beers as a possible but unconfirmed situation.
5. The premise does not provide enough structural detail to confirm that beers are present, only that people are intoxicated, which could be achieved through other means.
6. The syntactic emphasis in "getting drunk" is on the act of intoxication, not the specifics of how it occurs, thus the hypothesis about holding beers cannot be definitively derived from the premise.
7. The premise mentions a house party setting and alcohol consumption, but lacks the syntactic specificity to ascertain that beers are the particular type of alcohol being consumed.
8. The statement "some people are holding beers" introduces a specific scenario that is not directly mirrored in the structure or phrasing of the original premise.
