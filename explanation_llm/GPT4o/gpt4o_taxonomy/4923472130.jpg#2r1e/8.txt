1. The color of the shirt is explicitly mentioned as red in the premise, which directly supports the statement that a person wears a red shirt.
2. The premise specifies that the person is wearing a red shirt, which logically confirms the statement about the shirt's color.
3. Real-world understanding that articles of clothing such as shirts are typically worn supports the conclusion that the person is wearing the red shirt mentioned.
4. Based on common knowledge, if a person is described as being in a specific color shirt, it entails that they are wearing that shirt, satisfying the statement.
5. The presence of a red shirt in the premise inherently includes the action of wearing, as clothing is typically worn, not just present.
6. The probabilistic reasoning that people are usually described by what they wear leads to the conclusion that the person is indeed wearing the red shirt mentioned.
7. The unstated assumption that clothes mentioned in a description are worn by the person leads to the entailment of the statement from the premise.
8. Causal understanding of descriptions in language suggests that saying a person is "in" a shirt implies they are wearing it, which confirms the statement about the red shirt.
