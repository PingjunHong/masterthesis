1. The woman in the premise is described as standing behind a girl and helping her with an experiment, but there is no syntactic indication that she is the girl's mother, as suggested in the hypothesis.
2. The premise involves a woman and a girl working on an experiment, while the hypothesis introduces a mother-child relationship that is not explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the premise.
3. The structural rephrasing in the hypothesis assumes a familial relationship (mother and child) which is not supported by the syntactic content of the premise.
4. The premise uses a more general structure, referring to a woman and a girl, whereas the hypothesis specifies familial roles (mother and child) without syntactic evidence from the premise.
5. The syntactic alternation in the hypothesis shifts from a neutral description of people involved in an activity to assigning specific roles that are not syntactically derivable from the premise.
6. The premise uses coordination to describe the actions of standing and helping, while the hypothesis uses subordination by introducing the roles of mother and child, which is not a syntactic rephrase of the premise.
