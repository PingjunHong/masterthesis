1. Walking along the side of a bridge does not necessarily mean they are heading home; they could be walking for leisure or to reach any other destination.
2. The premise does not specify a destination or purpose for the walk, so assuming it is towards their home is not warranted.
3. There is no indication in the premise that the mother and daughter are near their home or heading in its direction.
4. Walking along the side of a bridge could be part of a scenic route or exercise routine, unrelated to the concept of going home.
5. The bridge could be located far from their home or in an area they are visiting, suggesting travel rather than returning home.
6. The premise lacks contextual clues or markers, such as carrying items typically associated with returning home, that would support the hypothesis.
7. The act of walking along a bridge does not inherently suggest a destination, including home, without additional context.
8. Real-world knowledge indicates that bridges are common in various settings and do not inherently relate to the concept of walking home.
9. The premise describes a physical location, but does not include temporal or situational details that would imply they are on their way home.
10. There is no mention of time or intention in the premise that would imply the walk is concluding at their home.
