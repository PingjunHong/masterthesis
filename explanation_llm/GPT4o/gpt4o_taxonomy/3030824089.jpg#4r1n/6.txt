1. The premise does not specify the location of the running, so the dog could be running inside.
2. No information about the dog's location in the premise, allowing for both indoor and outdoor scenarios.
3. The hypothesis specifies "outside," while the premise does not mention where the dog is running.
4. The premise lacks any spatial context, creating a location conflict with the hypothesis.
5. The hypothesis introduces an exclusive location ("outside") that is not contained within the premise.
6. The premise does not restrict the location, while the hypothesis assumes an outdoor setting.
7. The dog's activity in the premise is location-neutral, conflicting with the specific "outside" context in the hypothesis.
8. The hypothesis implies a location that is not logically exclusive or necessarily connected to the premise.
9. The premise leaves the running location ambiguous, but the hypothesis makes a definitive claim about being outside.
