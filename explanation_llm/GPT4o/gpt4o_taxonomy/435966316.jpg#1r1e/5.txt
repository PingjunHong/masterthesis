1. The premise mentions workers with life vests and hard hats, but does not specify the number of people on the boat; the hypothesis could be true if there are indeed three workers, but the premise does not confirm this detail.
2. The premise does not explicitly state that there are exactly three people on the boat, only that there are workers; the number of people is not mentioned, making the hypothesis plausible but unconfirmed.
3. The premise describes workers on a boat hanging from cables, but does not specify the exact count of the workers; the presence of three people is not mentioned, so the hypothesis could be true but is not entailed.
4. There could be more than three people on the boat, as the premise does not limit the number of workers mentioned; the hypothesis introduces a specific number that is neither supported nor contradicted by the premise.
5. The premise does not affirm the number of people on the boat; while the hypothesis states there are three, this specific detail is absent in the premise, making the hypothesis plausible but not necessarily true.
6. The premise describes workers on a boat but does not mention their number; the hypothesis suggests three, which is not confirmed by the premise, leaving it unsupported.
7. The hypothesis assumes there are three people on the boat, while the premise lacks any concrete evidence or mention of the exact number, resulting in a plausible but unverified statement.
8. The premise does not provide information about the number of people on the boat, thus the hypothesis that there are three people is not contradicted but also not supported.
9. The hypothesis introduces the idea of three people, but the premise simply outlines workers with safety gear, without specifying their number, leaving the hypothesis neither confirmed nor denied.
10. The premise indicates workers on a boat but does not specify the count; the hypothesis of three people is not mentioned, making it possible but not explicitly entailed.
