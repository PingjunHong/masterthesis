1. "Two people crossing by each other" implies more than one person, contradicting "There is one person outdoors."
2. "Two people" explicitly states the presence of two individuals, which contradicts "one person."
3. "Crossing by each other" requires at least two people, contradicting having only "one person."
4. "Two people" inherently means not one person, which directly contradicts "There is one person."
5. "Two" is a numerical value greater than "one," creating a contradiction with "There is one person outdoors."
