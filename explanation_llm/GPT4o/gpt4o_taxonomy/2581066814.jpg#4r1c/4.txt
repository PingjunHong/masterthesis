3. A man who is naked cannot simultaneously be in a suit, due to the inherent contradiction in clothing status.
4. A sidewalk is a different location than where a bike is typically ridden, suggesting different actions are taking place.
5. The action of riding a bike implies movement on a road or path, not walking on a sidewalk.
6. The premise describes a man without clothing, directly contradicting the description of a man in a suit.
