1. Cooking with five pots simultaneously implies using a lot of pots, as five is generally considered a large number of pots for cooking.
2. The phrase "at the same time" suggests the man is managing multiple tasks, which supports the interpretation of using many pots.
3. In cooking, using multiple pots often indicates preparing a complex or multi-component meal, which aligns with the idea of "a lot of pots."
4. The specific mention of "five pots" directly supports the claim of using a lot, as five exceeds the typical number of pots used in simpler meals.
5. Real-world cooking scenarios where multiple pots are used often involve preparing large quantities or varied dishes, supporting the hypothesis of using "a lot of pots."
6. The use of fire in multiple pots simultaneously suggests a large-scale cooking operation, consistent with the statement that many pots are involved.
7. Common knowledge about home kitchens suggests that using five pots at once is uncommon and indicates a significant cooking effort, validating the statement of "a lot of pots."
8. Probabilistically, the likelihood of someone cooking with fewer pots is higher than with five, thus supporting the statement as it involves an unusual scenario of many pots.
9. Given the effort required to manage five pots at once, it is reasonable to assume the individual is indeed using a lot of pots, as per the hypothesis.
