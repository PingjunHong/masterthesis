1. Sitting down facing each other does not imply being indoors, so the locations are structurally different.
2. Without shirts and shirtless are rephrasings, but the premise does not specify being indoors, which changes the meaning.
3. The structure of being shirtless is maintained, but the addition of indoors in the statement is not supported by the premise.
4. The premise does not specify the location as indoors, which changes the context of the sitting action.
5. Structural rephrasing of without shirts to shirtless is valid, but the setting is unspecified, making indoors a neutral addition.
6. The premise indicates sitting down facing each other, while the statement adds the location indoors, altering the scene.
7. Without shirts aligns with shirtless syntactically, but the premise lacks information about being indoors, differing in setting.
8. The rephrasing of two little kids to two children is correct, but indoors introduces an unsupported location.
9. Sitting down is structurally similar, but indoors is an additional context not present in the premise.
10. The structural equivalence of without shirts and shirtless does not extend to the mention of indoors, which is not inferred from the premise.
