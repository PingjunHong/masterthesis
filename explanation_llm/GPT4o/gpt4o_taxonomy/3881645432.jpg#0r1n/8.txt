1. The presence of a Geek Squad sign does not guarantee that the employee is wearing a blue shirt, as Best Buy employees wear different uniforms.
2. The employee’s specific attire is not mentioned in the premise, so assuming they are wearing a blue shirt is not necessarily correct.
3. While Best Buy employees frequently wear blue shirts, the premise does not specify the employee’s clothing color.
4. The premise provides no information about the employee's clothing, so the hypothesis that they are wearing a blue shirt is not definitively supported.
5. Employees at Best Buy might wear different uniforms depending on their role or department, and the premise does not clarify this.
6. The color of the employee's shirt is not stated in the premise, making the hypothesis about a blue shirt speculative.
7. The presence of a Best Buy and Geek Squad context does not causally ensure that the employee's shirt is blue.
8. The premise lacks details about the employee’s uniform, leaving the hypothesis about a blue shirt without necessary evidence.
9. Best Buy's branding often uses blue, but not every employee is required to wear a blue shirt, and this is not specified in the premise.
10. The Geek Squad sign relates to a service and not employee attire, making the hypothesis about a blue shirt an assumption.
