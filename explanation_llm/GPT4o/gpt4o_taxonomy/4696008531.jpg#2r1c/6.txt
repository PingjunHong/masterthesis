1. A person cannot simultaneously try to throw something and walk away from it.
2. Throwing an object requires being stationary or moving towards a target, not away from it.
3. Attempting to throw something implies facing the object, which contradicts walking away.
4. The action of throwing involves a forward motion, conflicting with the backward motion of walking away.
5. The direction of focus in throwing is inconsistent with turning one's back, as implied by walking away.
6. Physical preparation for throwing is incompatible with the posture of walking away.
7. Engaging in the act of throwing necessitates proximity to the object, whereas walking away increases distance.
