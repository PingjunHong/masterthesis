1. A person cannot simultaneously be trying to throw something and walking away from the throwing action, as these are opposing actions.
2. Throwing an object typically requires facing the target and preparing for the motion, which is inconsistent with walking away.
3. Walking away from a location suggests moving in a direction opposite to remaining in place to throw something.
4. The physical action of attempting to throw implies a stance and focus that contradicts the act of walking away.
5. In real-world scenarios, people do not throw objects while moving away from their intended target.
6. Throwing involves a forward motion towards the target, whereas walking away involves a backward or lateral motion, making the actions incongruent.
7. Probabilistically, if someone is preparing to throw, they are more likely to be stationary or moving towards the target rather than away.
8. The assumption of concurrent actions of throwing and walking away defies typical human behavior patterns during a throwing attempt.
9. Throwing something requires coordination and posture that are not associated with the action of walking away.
10. The logical sequence of preparing to throw something does not align with the movement pattern of walking away, as one action negates the possibility of the other occurring simultaneously.
