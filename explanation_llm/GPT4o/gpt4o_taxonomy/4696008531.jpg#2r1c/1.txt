The man in the black t-shirt is the same individual referred to in both the premise and the hypothesis, and his actions contradict each other.
The man referred to in the premise is actively trying to throw something, whereas the same man is described as walking away in the hypothesis.
The premise describes the man in the black t-shirt as engaged in an action, while the hypothesis describes him as walking away, indicating opposite activities.
The hypothesis refers to the same man as the premise, but his actions are inconsistent with each other.
The man in the black t-shirt mentioned in the premise cannot be simultaneously trying to throw something and walking away.
