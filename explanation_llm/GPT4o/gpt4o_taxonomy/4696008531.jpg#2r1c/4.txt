1. If the man is trying to throw something, he must be stationary or in a position to throw, not walking away.
2. Throwing typically requires a stance that is incompatible with walking away, indicating a contradiction.
3. The action of trying to throw implies a focus on an object or direction, whereas walking away implies a shift in focus and direction.
4. Engaging in the act of trying to throw something suggests the man is facing towards the target, not away from it.
5. The intent to throw involves preparation for that action, which is inconsistent with the physical movement of walking away.
6. The phrase "trying to throw" indicates an engagement with the activity at hand, whereas "walking away" suggests disengagement.
7. Attempting to throw involves physical readiness and orientation towards the target, not away from it.
8. The contradiction arises from an implication that when someone is trying to throw, they are likely in a position to complete the action, not moving away from it.
9. The concept of trying to throw suggests a forward or directed action, incompatible with the backward motion implied by walking away.
10. The premise involves a potential action in progress which requires focus, clashing with the hypothesis of leaving the scene.
