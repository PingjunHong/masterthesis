1. Horses and sheep are distinct animals, and farm equipment cannot be simultaneously pulled by both.
2. Horses are significantly larger and stronger than sheep, making it improbable for sheep to pull the same equipment as horses.
3. The premise explicitly states horses are pulling the equipment, which directly contradicts the statement about sheep.
4. Farm equipment typically requires the strength of larger animals like horses, not smaller animals like sheep.
5. The visual and physical capabilities required to work with farm equipment are generally associated with horses rather than sheep.
6. It's uncommon for sheep to be used for pulling farm equipment due to their size and strength limitations.
7. Real-world farming practices usually involve horses or other large animals for pulling equipment, not sheep.
8. The premise's description of the scene involves horses, which is inconsistent with the statement's mention of sheep.
9. Horses' pulling ability is well-documented and expected in farming contexts, unlike sheep, which are not traditionally used this way.
10. The physical characteristics of sheep do not align with the task of pulling heavy farm equipment, as described.
