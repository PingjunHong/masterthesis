1. If the equipment is being pulled by two horses, it cannot simultaneously be pulled by sheep.
2. Horses and sheep are distinct animals, so equipment pulled by horses cannot be described as being pulled by sheep.
3. The presence of two horses pulling the equipment contradicts the statement that sheep are pulling it.
4. The action performed by two horses (pulling equipment) excludes the possibility of sheep performing the same action at the same time.
5. The semantic meaning of "horses" and "sheep" are mutually exclusive in this context, creating a contradiction.
6. The premise specifies horses as the animals pulling the equipment, which directly opposes the claim of sheep doing so.
7. Two horses pulling the equipment is a factual detail that negates the possibility of sheep being involved in the pulling.
8. The logical structure of "pulled by two horses" directly contradicts "pulled by sheep" due to mutually exclusive subjects.
9. The description of the animals in the premise (horses) inherently conflicts with the description in the statement (sheep).
