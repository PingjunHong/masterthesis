1. The statement "The equipment is being pulled by sheep" contradicts the premise "Two men working on farm equipment that is being pulled by two horses" because "being pulled by two horses" rephrases to "not being pulled by sheep."
2. The phrase "being pulled by two horses" in the premise structurally indicates that the equipment is not being pulled by sheep as claimed in the statement.
3. "Two horses" in the premise syntactically negates "sheep" in the statement, creating a contradiction.
4. The structural wording "being pulled by two horses" directly contradicts the rephrased notion of "being pulled by sheep."
5. "Being pulled by sheep" represents a syntactic alternation that contradicts the original structure "being pulled by two horses" in the premise.
6. The coordination of "two horses" in the premise conflicts with the rephrased "sheep" in the statement, leading to a contradiction.
7. The statement's rephrased claim of "sheep" contradicts the premise's structural indication of "two horses" pulling the equipment.
8. The subordination of "two horses" in the premise negates the possibility of "sheep" stated in the hypothesis, resulting in a contradiction.
9. The syntactic alternation from "two horses" to "sheep" shifts the meaning and contradicts the original premise.
10. Replacing "two horses" with "sheep" in the statement creates a contradiction due to the structural rephrasing that alters the original meaning.
