1. The premise mentions boys against a wave, but does not specify whether they are sitting or standing, nor does it mention a beach setting.
2. The premise does not provide information about the presence of other people, so we cannot confirm if there is a group.
3. The premise describes boys interacting with a wave, which does not necessarily imply they are on a beach or sitting.
4. The premise lacks details about the specific location or activities of the boys, so the idea of them sitting on the beach is not supported.
5. There is no indication in the premise that additional people are present, so the hypothesis about a group cannot be confirmed.
6. The premise focuses on boys and a wave interaction, but does not mention or imply any beach or seated position.
7. The hypothesis introduces the concept of sitting, which is not supported by the details in the premise.
8. The premise does not address the setting explicitly as a beach, nor does it confirm that the boys are part of a larger group.
