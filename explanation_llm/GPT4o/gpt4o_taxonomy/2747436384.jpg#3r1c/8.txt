1. Boys with their backs against an incoming wave does not imply they are sitting; they could be standing or playing in the water.
2. The premise mentions boys, but the hypothesis refers to a group of people, which could include adults or females, thus not necessarily overlapping.
3. The fact that the boys have their backs against a wave doesn’t indicate their location on the beach; they could be in the water.
4. Being near an incoming wave doesn't imply sitting on the beach as they might be involved in activities like surfing or swimming.
5. The premise provides no indication of whether there are additional people present, so assuming a group is unwarranted.
6. The description of the boys’ position relative to the wave doesn’t confirm they are on the sand, where people typically sit.
7. Waves can be present at various parts of a beach, not only where people sit, so the boys' position doesn’t confirm they are seated on the beach.
8. The term "group of people" could imply a larger number than just the boys mentioned, without evidence of others.
9. The premise doesn’t specify the boys' activities, which might not include sitting, such as running or jumping.
10. The presence of incoming waves doesn’t necessarily mean a beach setting conducive to sitting; it could be a rocky or cliff area.
