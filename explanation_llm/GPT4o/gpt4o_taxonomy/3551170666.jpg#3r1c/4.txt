1. The premise specifies a golden retriever as the subject nursing the puppies, whereas the hypothesis changes the subject to a cat, which contradicts the identity of the subject described in the premise.
2. The premise establishes that a golden retriever is the animal involved in nursing, while the hypothesis incorrectly identifies the nursing animal as a cat, violating the logical identity established in the premise.
