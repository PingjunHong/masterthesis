1. Getting ready for a bike ride is not the same as already riding bicycles in the street.
2. Being ready for a ride implies future action, whereas riding is a current action.
3. The premise specifies that people are already on their bicycles, not merely preparing to ride.
4. The statement describes a preparatory action, contradicting the ongoing activity in the premise.
5. The temporal sequence is inconsistent: the premise describes an activity in progress, while the statement describes a future intention.
6. The statement does not confirm that the friends are already riding, which conflicts with the premise's depiction of people actively riding.
7. The premise indicates current helmet usage while riding, whereas the statement implies they are not yet riding and therefore not necessarily wearing helmets.
8. The premise focuses on an activity happening in the street, while the statement does not specify the location of the preparation.
