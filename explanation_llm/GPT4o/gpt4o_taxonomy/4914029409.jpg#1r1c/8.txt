2. The content specifies that all riders are wearing helmets, whereas the statement does not mention helmets, potentially contradicting safety regulations.
3. The statement suggests the riders are preparing for a ride, while the content describes them currently riding in the street, indicating a temporal contradiction.
4. The content shows people actively riding bicycles, whereas the statement implies they are still in the process of getting ready, suggesting a discrepancy in timing.
5. Real-world knowledge indicates that people readying their bikes are typically not yet on the street riding, which contrasts with the content's depiction of ongoing activity.
6. The statement portrays a morning scenario, but the content does not specify the time of day, which could contradict assumptions about when the activity is happening.
