1. The premise mentions a snowboarder on a wide plain of snow, but it does not indicate that the snowboarder is actively gliding.
2. The hypothesis introduces the idea of gliding, which is not mentioned in the premise, thus lacking supporting evidence.
3. The premise does not specify the snowboarder's movements, so the action of gliding is not confirmed.
4. The description of the terrain as a "wide plain" does not necessarily imply a field, and the specific action of gliding is absent in the premise.
5. The premise gives a static description without suggesting motion, while the hypothesis assumes dynamic movement.
6. The hypothesis suggests that the snowboarder is in motion, but this is not explicitly stated or implied in the premise.
7. The concept of a "field of snow" is introduced in the hypothesis, whereas the premise only mentions a "wide plain," which may or may not be synonymous.
8. The hypothesis assumes a specific action (gliding) that could be true but is not mentioned or evidenced by the premise.
9. The premise lacks any indication of movement or direction, which is necessary to support the hypothesis's claim of gliding.
10. The premise does not provide information about the snowboarder's activity beyond their presence, so the hypothesis's statement about gliding is unsupported.
