1. Being on a wide plain of snow does not necessarily mean the snowboarder is gliding over it; they could be stationary or preparing to snowboard.
2. The term "plain" and "field" are not interchangeable; a plain is a broad area, while a field is generally smaller, thus the snowboarderâ€™s location is not a definite match.
3. The activity of gliding is not specified in the premise; the snowboarder might be walking, standing, or performing tricks.
4. The presence of snow doesn't automatically imply the snowboarder is actively moving or gliding.
5. A snowboarder on a wide plain of snow could be engaged in activities other than gliding, such as resting or taking photos.
6. Without specific actions described, it cannot be assumed the snowboarder is in motion.
7. The premise does not provide any context about the snowboarder's movement, so gliding over a field can't be concluded.
8. Snowboarding involves multiple actions, and simply being on snow doesn't indicate the snowboarder's current action is gliding.
9. The description of the snow's surface as a "plain" does not convey motion, whereas "gliding" implies movement.
10. The setting described in the premise lacks any detail about the snowboarder's activity or motion status.
