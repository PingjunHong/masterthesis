1. Gliding over a field of snow is not structurally equivalent to being on a wide plain of snow.
2. A wide plain of snow does not necessarily imply the action of gliding.
3. Being on a plain of snow doesn't specify movement, whereas gliding implies motion.
4. The transformation from "on a wide plain" to "gliding over a field" changes the syntactic structure and meaning.
5. The use of "on" versus "gliding over" indicates different states, not just a rephrasing.
6. A field of snow might suggest a different spatial context than a wide plain of snow.
7. The term "field" might be interpreted differently than "plain," affecting the structural meaning.
8. Presence on snow doesn't equate to the activity of gliding, altering the syntactic implication.
9. "On a wide plain" suggests static presence, while "gliding over" suggests dynamic activity.
10. The rephrasing introduces an action (gliding) that isn't implied in the original premise.
