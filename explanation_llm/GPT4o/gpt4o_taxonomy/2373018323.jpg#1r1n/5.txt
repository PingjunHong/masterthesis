1. The premise mentions a blue hoodie, but does not specify whether the clothes are baggy, so the hypothesis introduces information about the style of clothing that is not supported by the premise.
2. The premise describes a half-wall covered in graffiti, but the hypothesis generalizes it to a wall without specifying any graffiti, leading to a lack of mention of the specific wall type in the hypothesis.
3. The premise specifies the type of garment as a hoodie, while the hypothesis vaguely refers to "baggie clothes," which may or may not include a hoodie, lacking specific mention.
4. The premise includes the detail that the flip is done off a half-wall, but the hypothesis only mentions a wall, missing the detail about the wall being a half-wall.
5. While the premise describes the action of doing a flip, the hypothesis introduces the idea of wearing baggie clothes, which is not mentioned or supported in the premise.
6. The premise specifies the color of the hoodie as blue, but the hypothesis does not mention any color, leaving out specific details mentioned in the premise.
7. The hypothesis implies a general style of clothing (baggie), whereas the premise provides a specific item (hoodie) without commenting on its fit, leaving the hypothesis with unsupported claims about clothing style.
8. The premise mentions graffiti on the wall, but the hypothesis does not include this detail, introducing a less detailed description of the environment.
9. The premise describes the man as young, but the hypothesis does not mention his age, which is a detail absent from the hypothesis.
10. The hypothesis uses the term "wares," which could imply a broader range of clothing items than just a hoodie, a detail that is not specified in the premise.
