1. Walking and sitting are mutually exclusive actions; one cannot walk and sit simultaneously.
2. The premise implies movement, while the hypothesis implies rest, creating a logical conflict.
3. Walking down the street and sitting in the street are contradictory activities.
4. The act of walking requires standing, which contradicts the act of sitting.
5. Temporal conflict exists as walking implies ongoing motion, whereas sitting implies a pause or stop.
6. The structural logic of movement versus stationary postures in the premise and hypothesis is exclusive.
7. The premise's action of walking cannot logically coincide with the hypothesis's action of sitting.
8. Walking indicates progression in location, while sitting suggests a fixed position, which conflicts.
9. The premise suggests a dynamic scene, which contradicts the static scene in the hypothesis.
10. Walking inherently involves being upright, which is incompatible with the seated position in the hypothesis.
