1. Walking down the street does not inherently involve setting down in the street, as walking typically implies staying upright and moving.
2. In most real-world scenarios, people walking down a street do not stop to set down in the street, as it would obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
3. Setting down in the street could imply sitting or lying down, which is not a natural continuation of walking unless specifically stated.
4. The act of walking suggests a continuous movement, whereas setting down implies stopping movement, creating a contradiction.
5. It is generally unsafe and uncommon for girls to set down in the middle of a street, contradicting the typical behavior of walking along it.
6. Traffic laws and societal norms usually discourage setting down in the street, especially if the street is meant for vehicles, making it unlikely in the context of walking.
7. Walking down the street suggests a purposeful or directed movement, whereas setting down might imply resting or loitering, contrasting intended actions.
8. In urban environments, streets are designated for walking or driving, not for setting down, which would be an unusual and contradictory action.
9. The assumption that girls are walking implies they are on a journey or headed somewhere, while setting down would interrupt this journey without further context.
10. If the girls were setting down in the street, it might suggest an emergency or unexpected situation, which contradicts the normalcy implied by simply walking.
