1. The premise describes a man preparing to cook, while the hypothesis assumes additional motivation of surprising his wife, which is not structurally implied.
2. The premise focuses on the man cooking, but the hypothesis introduces the concept of a surprise, which is not a structural rephrase.
3. The hypothesis adds the notion of intent (surprising his wife) which is not present in the structural elements of the premise.
4. The premise mentions cooking, whereas the hypothesis adds a relational context (surprising his wife) that is not a syntactic rephrase.
5. The action of cooking in the premise is structurally rephrased as a surprise for his wife in the hypothesis, but this rephrasing introduces new elements not present in the original structure.
6. The structural focus on cooking in the premise does not inherently imply the surprise element introduced in the hypothesis.
7. The premise's description of the man cooking lacks the structural context of a surprise found in the hypothesis, indicating a shift beyond mere syntactic alternation.
8. The premise and hypothesis diverge structurally because the premise does not contain the relational aspect of a surprise present in the hypothesis.
9. The premise structurally focuses on the act of cooking, while the hypothesis adds an inferential layer of intent not present in the original syntactic structure.
10. The structural rephrasing is incomplete as the surprise element in the hypothesis is not directly derived from the premise's syntax.
