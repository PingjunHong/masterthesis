1. The premise does not mention anything about the man's marital status or intentions, so there is no information confirming that he has a wife or intends to surprise someone.
2. The action of cooking meat in the kitchen does not inherently imply surprising someone, as cooking can be a routine activity.
3. There is no mention of a wife in the premise, so inferring her involvement is speculative.
4. The word "about" in "about to cook" suggests an intention to start cooking but does not clarify the purpose, such as surprising someone.
5. The premise describes an action (cooking), while the hypothesis implies a specific motive (surprising a wife), which is not directly supported by the premise.
6. "Dark-haired man" and "a man" may refer to the same individual, but the specific action of cooking does not imply the additional context of surprising someone.
7. The neutral label arises because the premise lacks sufficient details about the man's relationship status or his intentions with the cooking.
8. The premise provides details about physical actions and objects (watch, oven mitt) without indicating any emotional or social context, such as a surprise.
9. The hypothesis introduces additional context (wife, surprise) not explicitly found in the premise, making it an assumption rather than a semantic inference.
10. The premise is focused on the immediate physical situation, while the hypothesis adds an inferred narrative that is not semantically guaranteed by the premise.
