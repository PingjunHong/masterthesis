1. The premise does not mention the boy having long hair, so we cannot conclude that he is long-haired based on the provided information.
2. The premise does not specify the speed at which the boy is skateboarding, so the hypothesis's claim that he is riding at a fast pace is not supported by the premise.
3. The premise only states that the boy is on a skateboard and on a stone wall with graffiti; it does not provide details about the boy's hair length or speed, leaving these details unsupported.
4. There is no mention in the premise of the boy's pace while skateboarding, making the hypothesis's suggestion of a fast pace speculative.
5. The premise lacks any description of the boy's hair, so the hypothesis introducing the detail of him having long hair is not supported.
6. The premise does not include information about the boy's speed, so the assertion in the hypothesis that he is moving fast is not directly supported.
7. Details about the boy's appearance, such as having long hair, are absent in the premise, leaving the hypothesis's description unsubstantiated.
8. The premise describes a boy in a green shirt on a stone wall with graffiti but does not confirm any specifics about his hair or speed, which the hypothesis introduces without evidence.
9. The absence of information about the boy's hairstyle in the premise makes the hypothesis's claim about his long hair unsupported.
10. The hypothesis adds new information about the boy's speed that is not mentioned in the premise, making it unverified.
