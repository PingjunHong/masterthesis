The hypothesis introduces information about the child doing a jumping kick, which is supported by the premise, even though the premise includes additional information about the child's attire.
The premise includes additional context about the child's outfit, which is absent in the hypothesis, but this absence does not affect the truth of the hypothesis regarding the action performed.
The hypothesis is supported by the jumping kick action mentioned in the premise, regardless of the additional detail about the outfit.
The absence of the ninja outfit in the hypothesis does not introduce unsupported or new information; it simply omits a detail that does not impact the entailment of the action.
