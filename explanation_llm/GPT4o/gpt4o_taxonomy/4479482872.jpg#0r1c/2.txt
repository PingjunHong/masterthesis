1. "Shirtless" implies the boy is not wearing a shirt, whereas "nude" implies the boy is not wearing any clothes at all, creating a contradiction.
2. The premise states the boy is wearing a "black and red bathing suit," which contradicts the hypothesis that he is "nude."
3. The action "sits on the sand" by the seagull contradicts the action "eats his peanut butter sandwich" in the hypothesis, as the premise does not mention a sandwich.
4. The presence of a "black and red bathing suit" indicates the boy is clothed, contradicting the description of him being "nude."
5. The word "shirtless" indicates partial clothing, which directly contradicts "nude," meaning no clothing.
6. The premise makes no mention of a "peanut butter sandwich," which contradicts the hypothesis assertion that there is one.
7. "Sits" and "eats" describe different actions performed by the seagull, creating a contradiction between the premise and hypothesis.
