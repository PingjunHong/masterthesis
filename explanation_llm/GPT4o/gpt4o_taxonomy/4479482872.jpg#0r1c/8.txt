- Being shirtless does not equate to being nude, as the boy is wearing a bathing suit.
- The premise mentions the seagull sitting on the sand, not eating anything, so there is no information about a peanut butter sandwich.
- The presence of a bathing suit indicates that the boy is not nude, contradicting the statement.
- The premise provides no indication of food being present; therefore, a seagull eating a sandwich is a contradiction.
- Real-world understanding that wearing a bathing suit implies not being nude contradicts the statement of swimming nude.
- The scenario described does not include any mention of food, so the seagull eating a sandwich is unsupported and contradicts the premise.
- A bathing suit covers parts of the body, so the claim that the boy is nude is logically inconsistent.
- The description of the seagull sitting on the sand directly contradicts the idea of it eating something.
- Real-world knowledge suggests that if the boy is wearing a bathing suit, he cannot simultaneously be described as nude.
- The premise doesn't imply any interaction with food or a sandwich, which contradicts the statement about the seagull.
