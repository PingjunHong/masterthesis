1. The premise does not mention the content of the message, so it might be about anything, not specifically a firing.
2. The act of reviewing a message does not inherently imply that the message contains news about being fired.
3. Walking to work implies ongoing employment, which conflicts with the idea of being fired via text.
4. The phrase "being fired" suggests a specific action that is not confirmed by the premise.
5. The premise does not provide any evidence of employment termination, which is required to support the hypothesis.
6. The premise lacks any mention of employment status change, such as being fired.
7. There is no quantifier conflict in the premise indicating the certainty of being fired.
8. The logical structure of reviewing a message does not necessitate the message's content being employment-related.
9. Temporal context conflict: walking to work suggests current employment, conflicting with the immediate termination implied by being fired.
10. The hypothesis introduces a specific scenario not covered by the more general situation described in the premise.
