1. "Seven men and women are in a yellow boat" is a syntactic rephrasing that does not convey the same meaning as "A group of seven individuals wearing rafting gear, white water raft down a river," because the color of the boat is specified but does not denote the activity of rafting down a river.
2. The description of "Seven men and women are in a yellow boat" lacks the detail of rafting gear and the action of rafting down a river, showing structural alteration with different meaning.

4. The hypothesis structurally alters the premise by specifying the boat color as "yellow," which does not appear in the premise, resulting in a rephrasing with different details.
5. The premise involves the activity of "white water rafting down a river," which is not explicitly mirrored in the hypothesis, indicating syntactic alternation that does not preserve the original meaning.
6. The premise's description of "wearing rafting gear" is not matched in the hypothesis, which instead mentions "seven men and women in a yellow boat," altering the syntactic structure without retaining the same meaning.
7. The premise includes the action "white water raft down a river," while the hypothesis provides a static image of people in a boat, representing a structural rephrasing without equivalent content.
8. The hypothesis's focus on "seven men and women" in a "yellow boat" does not incorporate the premise's elements of rafting gear or river activity, showing syntactic-level rephrasing with a shift in meaning.
