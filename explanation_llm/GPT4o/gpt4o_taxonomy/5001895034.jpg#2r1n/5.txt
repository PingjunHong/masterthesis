2. The activity of kickboxing is not mentioned in the premise, leaving open the possibility of other forms of exercise.
3. The premise describes a workout in nature but provides no details about the specific exercise, meaning kickboxing is one of many possibilities.
4. The statement introduces the idea of kickboxing, which is not supported by the information given in the premise.
5. The type of workout is unspecified in the premise, so while kickboxing is possible, it is not confirmed.
6. The premise does not mention any specific workout routines, so the hypothesis about kickboxing lacks direct supporting evidence.
7. The hypothesis assumes an activity that is absent from the premise, where only a general workout is mentioned.
8. Without mention of kickboxing in the premise, the statement remains speculative.
9. The premise does not exclude kickboxing as a possibility, but it also does not confirm it, rendering the hypothesis neutral.
