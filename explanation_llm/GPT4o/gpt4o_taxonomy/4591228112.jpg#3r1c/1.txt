The man in the premise refers to the old man, while the man in the statement refers to a young man.
The reference to the man in the statement implies a young age, which contradicts the reference to the old man in the premise.
The description of the man in the premise as old cannot corefer with the description of the man as young in the statement.
Old man in the premise contrasts with the young man in the statement, leading to a contradiction in coreference.
The statement's reference to a young man cannot resolve to the old man described in the premise.
The man in the statement is described as young, conflicting with the premise's identification of the man as old.
Coreference resolution fails because the old man in the premise does not match the young man in the statement.
References to age in the premise and statement oppose each other, blocking successful coreference resolution.
The contradiction arises from the inability to corefer the old man in the premise with the young man in the statement.
