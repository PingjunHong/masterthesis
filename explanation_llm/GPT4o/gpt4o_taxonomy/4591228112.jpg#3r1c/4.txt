1. The term "old man" in the premise logically implies that the man is not young, which contradicts the statement that he is young.

3. The descriptor "old" inherently negates the descriptor "young" within the context of describing a person's age.
4. The structure of the premise uses "old man," meaning the man cannot simultaneously be "young," creating a contradiction.
5. The semantics of "old" directly oppose the semantics of "young," leading to a contradiction in the description of the man.
6. The logical implication of being "old" excludes the definition of being "young," thus contradicting the statement.
7. The phrase "old man" entails a stage of life that conflicts with the stage implied by "young."
8. In the premise, "old" signifies advanced age, which is incompatible with the youthful connotation of "young."
9. The premise uses a definitive age-related term "old," which logically negates the possibility of the man being "young."
10. The inherent meaning of "old" as used in the premise directly contradicts the attribute "young" given in the statement.
