1. A worker is employed, which contradicts the statement that the person is unemployed.
2. Being atop a building under construction indicates the person is actively working, not unemployed.
3. The presence of a worker implies employment, directly contradicting the idea of being unemployed.
4. Workers are typically employed, making it unlikely for an unemployed person to be working on a building.
5. A worker atop a building is engaged in employment activities, incompatible with being unemployed.
6. The premise describes an employed worker, whereas the statement suggests unemployment, which is logically inconsistent.
7. Construction work involves employed individuals, conflicting with the notion of unemployment in the statement.
8. The act of peering out from a building under construction suggests employment status, in contrast to the claimed unemployment.
9. An unemployed person would not be actively involved in construction work, which is implied by the premise.
10. Employment is a requirement for construction work, making it improbable for an unemployed person to be a worker atop a building.
