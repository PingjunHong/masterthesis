1. A worker is employed, and an unemployed person is not employed, creating a contradiction.
2. Peering from atop a building implies being on the building, not merely near it.
3. The statement specifies an unemployed person, which contradicts the premise of a worker.
4. Being atop a building is different from being near a building, leading to a contradiction.
5. The presence of a worker implies employment, which directly contradicts the term "unemployed."
6. The spatial relationship of being "atop" versus "near" the building contradicts the premise.
7. The premise involves a specific activity (peering from atop), which contradicts the undefined activity of simply being "near" in the statement.
