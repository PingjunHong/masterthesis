1. The term "worker" implies employment, which contradicts "unemployed person."
2. "Peers out from atop a building" suggests the person is on the building, while "near a building" implies being outside or away from it.
3. "A building under construction" indicates an active worksite, which is inconsistent with being unemployed.
4. "Worker" and "unemployed person" are antonyms in this context, creating a contradiction.
5. "Atop a building" specifies a location above, while "near a building" indicates proximity but not the same location.
