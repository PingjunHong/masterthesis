1. The premise describes a girl running, not a boy, so the statement about a boy running into a wall does not align with the gender mentioned.
2. There is no mention of a wall in the premise, making the statement about a boy running into a wall inconsistent with the scenario described.
3. The premise involves two people, one running and one sitting, but does not involve any collision with a wall, contradicting the statement.
4. The activity described in the premise is running and leaning over an object, which does not suggest or imply running into a wall.
5. The premise does not identify the gender of the person running beyond "girl," thus contradicting the statement about a boy running.
6. The premise involves a wool hat, but has no connection to a wall, which is necessary for the statement to be true.
7. Running and leaning over an object does not logically lead to running into a wall, creating a contradiction with the statement.
8. The premise suggests outdoor activity, while the action of running into a wall might imply an indoor scenario, contradicting the setting assumed by the statement.
9. The premise provides details about two individuals' actions, none of which include running into a wall, contradicting the statement.
10. The statement assumes a consequence (running into a wall) that is not supported by the activities described in the premise.
