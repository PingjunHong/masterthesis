- The premise describes a skier in the act of ski-jumping, not in preparation, so the hypothesis introduces an action not explicitly mentioned.
- While the skier could be preparing a trick, the premise does not provide evidence of preparation, only execution.
- The premise focuses on ski-jumping and observing skiers, lacking details about any trick preparation.
- The act of ski-jumping does not inherently imply that a trick is being prepared.
- The premise does not mention any specific activities or movements that suggest trick preparation.
- The presence of watching skiers does not confirm or deny any preparation for a trick by the skier.
- The hypothesis introduces the idea of preparation, which is not directly supported by the premise.
