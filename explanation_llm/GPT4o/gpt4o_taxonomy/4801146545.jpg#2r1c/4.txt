- The premise specifies that people are wearing only white and red, which logically excludes the possibility of wearing black.
- If people are wearing only white and red, then they cannot be wearing black simultaneously.
- The premise restricts clothing colors to white and red, contradicting the hypothesis that includes black clothing.
- "Only white and red" in the premise excludes other colors, including black, leading to a contradiction in the hypothesis.
- The use of "only" in the premise implies exclusivity to white and red, making black an impossible option.
- The logical structure of the premise only allows for white and red clothing, rendering any inclusion of black as incorrect.
