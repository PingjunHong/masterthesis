1. "A large number of people wearing black walking down the street" contradicts "A large number of people wearing only white and red are walking on a street" because the phrase "wearing only white and red" excludes the possibility of wearing black.
2. The statement "A large number of people wearing black walking down the street" is a structural rephrase that introduces a contradiction, as the premise specifies that people are wearing only white and red, ruling out any other colors, including black.
3. The structural difference in the statement introduces a contradiction by specifying black attire, which is not allowed by the premise's condition of wearing only white and red.
4. In the premise, "wearing only white and red" syntactically excludes any other color, such as black, creating a contradiction when the statement introduces people wearing black.
5. The rephrasing from "wearing only white and red" to "wearing black" alters the meaning structurally and contradicts the exclusive color description provided in the premise.
6. The phrase "wearing only white and red" in the premise is rephrased as "wearing black" in the statement, leading to a contradiction because both cannot be true simultaneously.
7. The structural alternation from "only white and red" to "black" introduces a contradiction, as the exclusive nature of "only" prevents the addition of any other color in the attire.
