1. The term "only white and red" implies the exclusion of any other colors, including black.
2. "Wearing only white and red" directly contradicts "wearing black" due to the exclusive nature of "only."
3. The use of "only" specifies that the colors worn are restricted to white and red, which means black is not worn.
4. The adjective "only" indicates that no additional colors are present beyond white and red, excluding black.
5. "Wearing black" is inconsistent with the description of "wearing only white and red" because "only" excludes black.
6. The semantic meaning of "only" restricts the attire to white and red, making the inclusion of black impossible.
7. "Only" signifies exclusivity to white and red, ruling out any possibility of black being worn.
8. The word "only" in the premise negates the possibility of black, which is mentioned in the hypothesis.
