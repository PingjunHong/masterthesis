1. "Little people" in the premise refers to children, but the statement does not mention a birthday party context.
2. "Little people" suggests children, yet the statement describes an action unrelated to a party setting.
3. The phrase "many little people" implies a group of children at a party, contrasting with the statement's focus on children running down the street.
4. The premise implies a stationary event for children, whereas the statement suggests movement away from a party.
5. The contradiction arises because the premise's "little people" at a party cannot be the same children running down the street in the statement.
