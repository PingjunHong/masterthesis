1. Birthday parties typically occur in confined spaces like homes or venues, not the street, making it unlikely that children would be running down the street as part of the party.

3. Running down the street suggests a lack of supervision, which contradicts the typical parental supervision expected at a birthday party.
4. Birthday parties are generally organized and controlled events, while children running down the street implies chaos and lack of organization.
5. The premise indicates an indoor or backyard setting, whereas the statement suggests an outdoor public setting, which is inconsistent with the premise.
6. Street running is a potentially dangerous activity, contrary to the safe environment usually associated with a birthday party for children.
7. The statement suggests children are leaving the party, which contradicts the notion that the party is meant for them to enjoy.
8. Parties are usually held in spaces designated for safe activities and games, not in streets where running could be hazardous.
9. The premise does not include any indication of outdoor activities or street games, which makes the street setting incongruent with the idea of a birthday party.
