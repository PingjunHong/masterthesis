1. Walking in a busy city at night implies that it is nighttime, whereas eating lunch typically occurs during the daytime.
2. Being outside in a busy city is inconsistent with being inside a restaurant, as one cannot be in two places simultaneously.
3. The activity of walking is distinct from the activity of eating, and one cannot perform both actions at the same time in the same context.
4. A large group of people walking suggests movement and transit, whereas eating lunch in a restaurant implies being stationary.
5. The setting described is a busy city at night, incompatible with the customary time for lunch, which is during midday.
6. The premise focuses on a group activity (walking), whereas the statement describes an individual or smaller group activity (eating lunch), leading to a contradiction in the nature of the actions.
