1. Busy city streets at night are generally not associated with people eating lunch, which typically occurs during the day.
2. The setting described involves a group walking outside, whereas eating lunch typically takes place indoors in a restaurant.
3. Nighttime in a city is usually associated with dinner or nightlife activities, not lunch.
4. The real-world understanding is that lunch is a midday meal, and nighttime falls outside the typical hours for lunch.
5. Restaurants are typically more crowded during dinner hours than at night rather than lunch, making the scenario improbable.
6. People walking in a city at night are unlikely to be simultaneously eating lunch, as these are two distinct activities that occur at different times and settings.
7. A large group walking at night suggests they are engaged in an outdoor activity, incompatible with the indoor activity of eating lunch.
8. The busy city at night suggests nightlife or evening activities, while lunch is a daytime activity.
9. Logically, lunch is a meal that occurs in the afternoon, conflicting with the nighttime setting described.
10. The assumed information about meal times in most cultures places lunch well before nightfall, creating an inconsistency with the statement.
