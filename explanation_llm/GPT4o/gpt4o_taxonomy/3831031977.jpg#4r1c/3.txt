1. Looking down a mountain range implies looking towards the ground, while looking into the sky implies looking upwards, creating a contradiction in direction.
2. The action of looking down a mountain range is structurally incompatible with the action of looking into the sky.
3. The syntactic structure "look down" contrasts with "look into," where "down" suggests a downward direction and "into the sky" suggests an upward direction.
4. Viewing a mountain range involves focusing on the landscape below, whereas viewing the sky involves focusing on the atmosphere above, structurally opposing each other.
