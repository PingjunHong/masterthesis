- The premise does not specify the number of people involved beyond the six rescuers, so the presence of a seventh person is not mentioned.
- The premise does not explicitly state that the rescuers are saving the man, only that they are placing him on a transport device.
- The term "saving" implies a broader context or action that is not detailed in the premise, which only describes the act of placing the man on a transport device.
- The premise does not mention the total number of people involved in the scenario beyond the rescuers; the injured man could be one of the six rescuers.
- The premise describes cooperation to place the man on a transport device, but does not specify that the intent is to save him, as there is no mention of a rescue effort beyond the action described.
- The premise does not provide information about the outcome or purpose of placing the injured man on the transport device, so the hypothesis assumes an intent not mentioned.
- The statement assumes there is a seventh person involved, but the premise only provides information about six rescuers and an injured man, without explicitly stating he is separate from the group of rescuers.
