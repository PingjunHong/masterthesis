1. The premise does not specify the type of log being sawed, so it cannot be assumed to be an oak log.
2. The material of the log is not mentioned, which leaves open possibilities other than oak.
3. "Log" in the premise could imply any type of tree, not necessarily an oak.
4. There is no information in the premise that explicitly links the log to being oak.
5. The assumption that the log is oak is not supported by any details in the premise.
6. The premise lacks specifics about the log's type, making "oak" an arbitrary addition.
7. The hypothesis introduces a detail (oak) not present or implied in the premise.
8. The premise provides no evidence to suggest the log is made of oak wood.
9. "Oak" is an unstated and assumed detail with no backing from the premise.
10. The type of log is unspecified, so assuming it is oak is speculative.
11. The premise does not restrict the log to any particular species, including oak.
12. No causal or probabilistic reasoning in the premise suggests the log is oak.
13. "Oak" is an additional detail not required or inferred by the information given.
