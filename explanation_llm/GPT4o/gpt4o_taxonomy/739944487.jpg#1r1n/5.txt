1. The premise does not mention the presence of islands, so there's no evidence that they are rowing towards any islands.
2. The activity of fishing is not mentioned in the premise, so there is no evidence to support that any of the people in the rowboat are fishing.

4. While there are seagulls mentioned in the premise, their presence does not imply the proximity of islands.
5. The premise does not provide information about individual activities of the people in the rowboat, such as fishing.
6. The ocean setting in the premise does not inherently indicate the presence of islands nearby.
7. There is no indication in the premise that the group of people has any specific destination, such as islands.
8. The premise does not specify the actions of each individual in the rowboat, leaving the hypothesis about one person fishing unsupported.
9. The existence of islands is an additional detail introduced in the hypothesis that is not addressed in the premise.
