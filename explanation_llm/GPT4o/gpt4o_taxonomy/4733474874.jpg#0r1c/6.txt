1. Only people wearing black shirts are in the vehicle, so the driver cannot be wearing a purple shirt.
2. The driver must be wearing a black shirt, not a purple shirt.
3. There is a logical exclusivity between wearing black shirts and wearing a purple shirt, indicating a contradiction.
4. Quantifier conflict arises as all individuals are described with black shirts, excluding the possibility of a purple shirt.
5. The premise specifies a uniform clothing color for all individuals, creating a conflict with the hypothesis.
6. Structural exclusivity implies that the driver is part of the group wearing black shirts, conflicting with the statement about a purple shirt.
7. The premise sets a condition that excludes any other shirt color, thus contradicting the hypothesis.
8. The description of the group does not allow for any exceptions in shirt color, thereby contradicting the statement about the driver.
9. The exclusivity of shirt color in the premise negates the possibility of the driver wearing a different color.
