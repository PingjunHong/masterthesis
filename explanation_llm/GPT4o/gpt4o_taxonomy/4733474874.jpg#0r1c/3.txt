2. The statement specifies a color for the driver's shirt that is different from the color mentioned for the group, indicating a contradiction.
3. The premise describes everyone in black shirts, while the hypothesis introduces a different color for the driver's shirt, creating a structural contradiction.
4. The contradiction arises from the structural shift where the hypothesis specifies the driver's shirt color as purple, diverging from the premise's description of black shirts.
5. The hypothesis syntactically alters the premise by specifying a different shirt color for the driver, contradicting the uniform description in the premise.
6. The premise's description of black shirts is structurally contradicted by the hypothesis specifying a purple shirt for the driver.
7. The hypothesis introduces a syntactic alternation of shirt color for the driver, which contradicts the premise's uniform shirt color description.
8. The premise describes a uniformity in shirt color that is structurally contradicted by the hypothesis specifying a different color for the driver.
9. The contradiction is evident in the syntactic rephrasing where the premise describes black shirts and the hypothesis specifies a purple shirt for one individual.
10. The structural rephrasing of shirt color in the hypothesis contradicts the premise's description of everyone wearing black shirts.
