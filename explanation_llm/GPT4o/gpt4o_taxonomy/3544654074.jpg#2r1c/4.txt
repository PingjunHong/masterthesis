- If the couple is newlywed, they are not divorced because newlywed implies they recently married.
- The term "newlywed" logically contradicts "divorced" as it describes a recent marriage, not a dissolution.
- A couple described as "newlywed" cannot simultaneously be divorced, as "newlywed" indicates current marriage status.
- The semantics of "newlywed" inherently exclude the possibility of being divorced, as newlywed denotes a recent union.
- Being newlywed logically necessitates the couple is currently married, directly opposing the notion of being divorced.
- The premise's description of the couple as newlywed entails they are not divorced, as newlywed signifies they were recently married.
- The structure of the premise logically precludes the possibility of divorce, given the implication of ongoing marriage inherent in "newlywed."
- The semantics of "laughing and talking amongst themselves" suggest a positive interaction typical of couples in a relationship, not divorced couples.
