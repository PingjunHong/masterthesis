1. Being on the library steps does not specify whether the steps are inside or outside the library.
2. Libraries often have steps outside leading to the entrance, so the child could be on those rather than inside.
3. The statement doesn't provide information about the location of the steps, leaving both inside and outside possibilities open.
4. The term "library steps" can refer to the exterior steps leading to the library, not necessarily inside.
5. The premise lacks details about the architecture or layout of the library, so the location of the steps is ambiguous.
6. The phrase "on the library steps" is not inherently linked to the interior of the library.
7. It is common for library steps to be outside, so without further context, the statement about being inside is not supported.
8. The premise does not mention entering the library, which would be necessary for the steps to be inside.
9. Without additional context, the steps could be part of an outdoor structure associated with the library.
10. The child's position on library steps doesn't logically lead to the conclusion that they are inside the library.
