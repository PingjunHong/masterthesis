1. The premise only mentions the child being on the library steps, without specifying if those steps are inside or outside the library, leaving the location ambiguous.
2. The premise does not provide information about the steps being inside, so the hypothesis introduces additional details not evident in the premise.
3. There is no mention in the premise of the steps being located within the library building, so the hypothesis goes beyond the given information.
4. The premise lacks specific information about the location of the steps in relation to the library's interior, making the hypothesis possible but unsupported.
5. The premise simply states the child is on the library steps, without indicating whether these steps are external or internal, leaving room for both possibilities.
6. The location of the steps as being inside is not mentioned in the premise, meaning the hypothesis introduces an unsupported assumption.
7. The premise does not specify the steps' position relative to the library's interior, so the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given information.
8. The premise does not clarify whether the steps are a part of the library's internal structure, rendering the hypothesis neutral due to lack of evidence.
