1. The premise states that the child is on the library steps, but it does not specify whether the steps are inside or outside the library.
2. The premise describes the child as being on the library steps, which could include steps outside the entrance or inside the building, leaving the location ambiguous.
3. The statement assumes the steps are inside, but the premise does not confirm or deny whether the steps are located indoors or outdoors.
4. The premise mentions the child being on steps associated with the library, without providing information about the steps' location relative to the library's interior.
5. There is no information in the premise that specifies the steps are located within the library itself, allowing for multiple interpretations of the child's position.
6. The lack of explicit detail about the steps' location in the premise means it is equally plausible for the steps to be inside or outside the library.
7. The premise does not include any indication of the library's architectural layout, leaving the position of the steps open to interpretation.
8. Without a description of the library's structure in the premise, the assumption that the steps are inside is not directly supported or contradicted.
