1. The premise does not specify whether the building is a work building or not, so the hypothesis introduces additional information that is not mentioned.
2. The premise does not mention the purpose of the people talking; they might not be preparing to enter the building for work-related reasons.
3. There is no indication that the people intend to enter the building, whether for work or any other purpose.
4. The premise does not provide information about the time of day or context that would suggest the people are preparing for work.
5. The sign 'HI-POINTE' does not specify the nature of the building, so it is not necessarily a work building.
6. The premise mentions people talking, but it does not indicate that they are having a chat specifically before work.
7. The sign 'HI-POINTE' could refer to various types of buildings, such as commercial, residential, or recreational, not necessarily a workplace.
8. The premise lacks details about the relationship between the people and the building, leaving their intentions ambiguous.
9. The activity of talking does not inherently imply a connection to work-related activities or entering a work building.
10. The premise does not include any indication of the people's plans after talking, so going into the building for work remains an unsupported assumption.
