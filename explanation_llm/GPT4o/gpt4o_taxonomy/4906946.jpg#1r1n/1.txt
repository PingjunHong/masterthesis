1. The "two roadside workers" in the premise may not necessarily be the "two men" referred to in the hypothesis.
2. The premise does not specify the activity of the workers, so "placing construction cones" is not confirmed.
3. The premise does not mention any pipeline, thus "preparation of a new pipeline building" cannot be linked to anything in the premise.
4. The "construction cones in the background" are not specifically associated with the actions of the "two roadside workers," hence their roles are not clarified.
5. The workers' attire in the premise does not specify their task, so it is unclear whether they are engaged in laying a pipeline.
6. The premise does not provide enough detail about the actions of the workers to support the specific activity mentioned in the hypothesis.
7. The reference to "construction cones" in the premise does not imply the purpose described in the hypothesis.
8. The "lime green safety jackets, white hard hats and gloves" attire description in the premise does not specify their task, leaving their role ambiguous.
9. The premise's description of the scene with "construction cones in the background" does not necessarily correlate with the hypothesis's description of "placing construction cones."
