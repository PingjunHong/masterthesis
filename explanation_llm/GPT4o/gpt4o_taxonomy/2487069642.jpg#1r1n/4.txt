1. Demonstrating life vest usage is part of safety procedures, but the premise does not specify if other safety procedures are being demonstrated.
2. The premise does not mention the timing of the demonstration, so it is unclear if it is happening before takeoff.
3. The attire of the flight attendant being yellow is not relevant to the timing or scope of the demonstration.
4. The premise specifies life vest usage, but safety procedures could include other elements not addressed in the premise.
5. The premise only mentions a single action, which does not imply a comprehensive demonstration of all safety procedures.
6. The context of the demonstration (e.g., before takeoff or during another phase of the flight) is not specified in the premise.
7. The term "demonstrates" in the premise does not inherently indicate the specific time or sequence relative to the flight's schedule.
8. The premise focuses on the demonstration of one specific item, lacking information on whether it's part of a standard pre-takeoff routine.
9. The mention of a life vest does not conclusively cover the full range of safety protocols typically addressed before a flight departs.
10. The phrase "demonstrates life vest usage" does not logically necessitate the action occurring exclusively before takeoff, leaving ambiguity.
