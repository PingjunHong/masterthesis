1. The premise describes an older man leaning, not a young man jogging, creating a contradiction between the age and the activity described.
2. The premise involves a stationary action (leaning) while the hypothesis involves a dynamic action (jogging), which contradicts the state of motion implied.
3. The premise specifies the man as older, directly contradicting the hypothesis's description of the man as young.
4. The premise describes a man leaning, which contradicts the hypothesis's depiction of a man jogging, as these actions cannot occur simultaneously.
5. The premise mentions a man leaning against a pedestal, indicating he is not jogging, which contradicts the hypothesis describing jogging.
6. The semantic implication of "older man" in the premise contradicts the semantic implication of "young man" in the hypothesis, as they represent different age groups.
7. The setting described in the premise (outside of an ornate building) does not align with the activity of jogging described in the hypothesis, which suggests a contradiction in location and action.
