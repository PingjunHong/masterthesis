1. The premise does not specify whether the people carrying the bag are sailors, so we cannot conclude that sailors are involved.
2. The premise describes a boat, but there is no mention of it being a sailboat, leaving the type of boat unspecified.
3. The presence of another person and boat in the background does not imply they are sailors or that the boat is a sailboat.
4. The activity described in the premise does not confirm that the individuals are getting into the boat, only that they are carrying a bag toward it.
5. The hypothesis introduces the concept of sailors, which is not addressed in the premise, leaving it unsupported.
6. The premise involves carrying a bag into a boat, while the hypothesis involves getting into a sailboat, which are distinct actions not necessarily connected.
7. The premise does not mention the occupation or role of the individuals, so assuming they are sailors lacks evidence.
8. There is no indication in the premise that the boat is used for sailing, leaving the hypothesis of a sailboat unsupported.
9. The presence of three men in the premise does not imply any information about their profession or activities as sailors.
10. The premise does not specify if the boat is being boarded or simply approached, which does not support the hypothesis of getting in.
