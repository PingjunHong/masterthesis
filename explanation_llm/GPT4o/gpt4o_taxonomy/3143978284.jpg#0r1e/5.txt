1. The premise does not specify whether the dress is entirely orange or a combination of orange and brown; it could have brown as the dominant color.
2. The hypothesis assumes the baby is wearing only orange, but the premise indicates the dress has both orange and brown, leaving room for interpretation.
3. The statement lacks explicit confirmation from the premise that the baby is wearing orange as the primary or only color.
4. The premise mentions a dress with orange and brown, but does not confirm the extent or predominance of the orange color.
5. While the hypothesis states the baby is wearing orange, the premise includes brown as well, which creates ambiguity not resolved by the premise alone.
6. The premise describes a dress with two colors, and it doesn't specify which color is more prominent, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
7. The statement simplifies the premise by focusing only on the orange part, whereas the premise provides a more complex color description.
8. The premise mentions both orange and brown without detailing which color stands out, making the hypothesis about wearing orange speculative.
9. The hypothesis infers that orange is the primary color without definitive evidence from the premise.
10. The absence of mention that the orange is significant or overwhelming in the dress makes the hypothesis not fully supported by the premise.
