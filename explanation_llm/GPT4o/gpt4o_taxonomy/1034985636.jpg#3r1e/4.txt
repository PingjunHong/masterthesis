The electric guitar is a type of guitar, so playing an electric guitar implies playing a guitar.
The phrase "on stage" is consistent in both the premise and the hypothesis, so the setting remains unchanged.
The word "man" is used in both the premise and hypothesis, indicating the subject remains the same.

The premise specifies the type of guitar as electric, while the hypothesis generalizes to any type of guitar, which includes electric guitars.
The premise specifies "electric guitar," which logically includes the more general term "guitar" used in the hypothesis.
The premise does not introduce any additional elements that would contradict the hypothesis.
