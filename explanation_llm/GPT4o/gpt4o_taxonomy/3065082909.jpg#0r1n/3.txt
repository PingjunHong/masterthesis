1. The sign the woman is holding states that 'Freedom is free' is structurally different from the premise, which mentions the woman holding a sign but does not specify its content.
2. The content of the sign, 'Freedom is free,' introduces new information not present in the structural details of the premise.
3. The statement focuses on the specific content of the sign, while the premise provides a broader context of the scene without detailing what the sign says.
4. The premise describes the scene structurally without specifying the sign's message, making the statement neutral due to the introduction of details not covered in the premise.
5. The structural rephrasing in the statement emphasizes the sign's content, which is absent from the syntactic construction of the premise.
6. The hypothesis introduces a detail through syntactic specificity that is not structurally rephrased from the premise's description.
7. The inclusion of the sign's message in the statement creates a neutral inference because it is not a syntactic alternation of any part of the premise.
