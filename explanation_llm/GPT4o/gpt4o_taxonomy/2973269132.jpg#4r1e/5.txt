1. The hypothesis mentions "preying," which implies an active pursuit or hunt, whereas the premise only states that the lioness is closing in, and it doesn't confirm if the lioness is actively preying at that moment.
2. The premise describes the lioness closing in, but this does not necessarily mean it is in the act of preying; it could be stalking or watching without intent to attack immediately.
3. The premise does not specify the outcome of the lioness closing in, so it is unclear if the lioness intends to prey, making the hypothesis unsupported by the evidence.
4. The act of preying involves capturing or attacking, and the premise does not provide information on whether the lioness has reached that stage, so the hypothesis is not directly supported.
5. The premise lacks specific details about the lioness's intentions or actions beyond closing in, leaving the hypothesis without direct confirmation or evidence.
6. The hypothesis implies a broader context of hunting behavior, while the premise provides a limited snapshot that doesn't explicitly indicate preying.
7. The premise does not mention the lioness's actions after closing in, so the hypothesis introduces additional assumptions not directly evidenced.
8. The hypothesis assumes a definitive action of preying, while the premise only suggests a potential lead-up to such an action without confirmation.
