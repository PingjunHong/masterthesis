1. The premise specifies "four women," which directly contradicts the statement that mentions "four men."
2. The gender mentioned in the premise is "women," while the statement claims "men," leading to a contradiction based on the gender difference.
3. The number "four" in both the premise and statement is consistent, but the gender discrepancy creates a contradiction.
4. The term "women" in the premise logically excludes "men," making the statement contradictory.
5. The semantic structure of the premise involves females ("women") in the activity, which clashes with the semantic structure of the statement involving males ("men").
6. The premise describes an activity involving women, whereas the statement describes the same activity involving men, creating a contradiction due to the subject mismatch.
7. The use of "women" as the subject in the premise logically negates the possibility of "men" being the subject as stated, leading to a contradiction.
8. The contradiction arises from the logical implication that "four women" cannot simultaneously be "four men" in the context of the activity described.
