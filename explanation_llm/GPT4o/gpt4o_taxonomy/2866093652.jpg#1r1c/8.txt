1. The premise explicitly mentions women, not men, so the statement contradicts the gender specified in the premise.
2. Competitive rollerskating is specified to involve women, and thus the mention of men does not align with the given information.
3. The number of participants in the premise is four women, which contradicts the statement mentioning four men.
4. Based on real-world understanding, "women" and "men" refer to different gender groups, and therefore the premise and statement refer to different groups of people.
5. The activity described involves only women, making the inclusion of men in the statement inaccurate.
6. The premise does not include men, so the statement about men contradicts the observed participants.
7. Assumed knowledge about gender identity indicates "women" and "men" are distinct, and the premise specifies women in the activity described.
8. Probabilistic reasoning suggests that if the premise mentions only women, then no men are part of the described rollerskating activity.
9. Causally, if the premise mentions women, then the statement mentioning men cannot be true simultaneously within the same context.
10. The distinction between "women" and "men" is assumed to be understood, leading to the contradiction in the statement given the premise.
