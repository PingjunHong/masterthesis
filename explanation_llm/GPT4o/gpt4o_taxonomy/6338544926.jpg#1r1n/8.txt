1. The premise mentions two people playing American Football, but does not specify their positions, so it doesn't necessarily mean one is a lineman and the other is a quarterback.
2. The premise describes a player trying to stop another from throwing the ball, which doesn't specify whether a touchdown is in progress or if it is game-winning.
3. The premise lacks information on the game's score or context, so it does not imply that any ongoing play will result in a game-winning touchdown.
4. The premise does not mention a touchdown; it simply describes an attempt to prevent a throw, which could happen anywhere on the field and not necessarily lead to a touchdown.
5. There is no information in the premise about the specific roles or identities of the players involved, so it does not confirm that one is a lineman and the other is a quarterback.
6. The action of stopping someone from throwing the ball could occur in various scenarios in football, not limited to a situation involving a game-winning touchdown.
7. The premise does not provide details about the game's timing or stakes, which are necessary to determine if a touchdown would be game-winning.
8. The premise indicates a defensive action, but does not imply any specific outcome such as a game-winning play, which involves additional context not present in the premise.
9. The description of a player trying to prevent a throw does not inherently suggest the presence of a lineman or quarterback, as these roles are not explicitly mentioned.
10. Real-world understanding of football positions and game scenarios is required to know that the premise does not inherently support the statement's specific claim about a lineman, quarterback, or game-winning touchdown.
