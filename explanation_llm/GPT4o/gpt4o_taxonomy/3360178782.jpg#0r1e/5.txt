1. The premise mentions consumers walking through a market, but does not specify that they are purchasing vegetables; they could simply be browsing without buying anything.
2. The premise describes the market as having a busy store behind the consumers, but does not explicitly mention that the market itself is busy, so the hypothesis cannot be confirmed.
3. The premise refers to a group of consumers, but does not mention that they are shoppers actively making purchases, which is a requirement for the hypothesis.
4. The premise does not confirm that the market is specifically public, as it only mentions the presence of consumers and a store in the background.
5. The activity of purchasing vegetables is not directly observed or mentioned in the premise, so it is not entailed by the hypothesis.
6. The premise does not specify the state of the market; it could be busy at another time, but not necessarily when the consumers are present.
7. The premise does not mention the act of purchasing, implying that consumers could be engaging in other activities like browsing or socializing.
