1. The premise does not specify the location, so the dogs could be on any deserted beach, not necessarily in Hawaii.
2. There is no information in the premise about the dogs' location being Hawaii, leading to a lack of definitive connection.
3. The premise allows for multiple possible locations for the dogs, and Hawaii is only one of many possibilities.
4. The concept of "deserted beach" in the premise does not logically imply the specific location of Hawaii.
5. The statement introduces a specific location (Hawaii) that is not established or suggested by the premise.
6. The premise's use of "some" implies a possibility of other locations, not exclusively Hawaii.
7. The premise does not restrict the location to Hawaii, creating a logical gap in asserting the dogs are there.
8. The hypothesis assumes a specific geographical location without evidence from the premise.
9. The premise's generic description of a "deserted beach" conflicts with the specific location given in the statement.
