Workers standing implies they are in the act of standing, which matches the state described in the statement.
The premise specifies workers are on a lift, and the statement confirms their position as on a lift.
The action described in the premise, standing, is directly reflected in the statement, reinforcing the entailment.
The grammatical structure of 'standing on a lift' implies 'stand on a lift,' which is the essence of the hypothesis.
Both premise and statement describe the same scenario—workers being on a lift and standing—without any deviation in meaning.
The semantics of 'standing' naturally entail 'stand,' as standing is the continuous form of the verb 'stand.'
The noun 'workers' and the verb 'stand' are consistent across both premise and statement, ensuring logical continuity.
The use of present continuous tense in 'standing' logically supports the present tense 'stand' as an ongoing action.
The spatial relation between the workers and the lift remains unchanged from premise to statement, confirming entailment.
The premise establishes the context and action (standing on a lift), which are mirrored precisely in the hypothesis (stand on a lift).
