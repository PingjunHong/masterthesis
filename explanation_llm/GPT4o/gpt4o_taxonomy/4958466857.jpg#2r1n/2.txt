1. The term "homeless men" does not necessarily imply "friends," as friendship is not determined by homelessness.
2. "Dressed in gray" provides specific attire details missing in "friends," which does not specify clothing.
3. "Sleeping dog" does not equate to "pet dog," as a sleeping dog is not identified as a pet.
4. "Purple leash" is a specific detail not mentioned in "pet dog," which lacks leash color information.
5. "Against a wall" is common in both, but does not clarify the relationship between "homeless men" and "friends."
6. "Two homeless men" does not imply ownership or companionship of the dog, whereas "their pet dog" suggests possession.
