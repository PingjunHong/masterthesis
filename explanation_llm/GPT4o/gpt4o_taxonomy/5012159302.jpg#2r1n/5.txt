1. The premise mentions "farmers" but does not specify their gender, so assuming they are men is unsupported by the premise.
2. The premise states that the farmers are working on the tractor, but it does not specifically say they are fixing it.
3. The premise does not mention that the farmers are exclusively men, leaving open the possibility that women could be among them.
4. The use of overalls is mentioned in the premise but does not imply that only men are wearing them.
5. The premise does not explicitly state that the individuals working are men, so the hypothesis introduces an unsupported gender assumption.
6. The premise speaks of a tractor being "almost fixed," but it does not explicitly state that the farmers are actively working to fix it at that moment.
7. The premise does not include any information about the gender roles of the farmers, making the assumption of them being men unsubstantiated.
8. The premise's mention of "farmers" does not equate to them being men, yet the hypothesis assumes this without evidence.
9. The statement in the hypothesis that "men" are working is not directly supported by the premise, which only refers to "farmers."
10. The gender of the farmers is not specified, so assuming they are men is an addition not supported by the premise.
