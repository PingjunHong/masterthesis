1. Walking down the street and walking towards a bus stop are different actions and destinations.
2. Walking down the street does not necessarily imply walking towards a bus stop.
3. The location conflict arises because the street and bus stop are distinct places; walking down the street does not specify a destination.
4. The premise does not mention a bus stop, creating a location conflict with the hypothesis.
5. The structural exclusivity implies that walking down the street and walking towards the bus stop are mutually exclusive in terms of direction.
6. Walking down the street can involve various destinations, so the hypothesis about the bus stop is not logically exclusive.
7. The premise does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the direction towards a bus stop.
8. There is no temporal indication in the premise to suggest the woman is heading to any specific location, such as a bus stop.
9. The quantifier conflict arises because "a bus stop" is not specified in the premise, leading to ambiguity in the hypothesis.
10. The hypothesis assumes a specific purpose for the woman's walk that is not present in the premise.
