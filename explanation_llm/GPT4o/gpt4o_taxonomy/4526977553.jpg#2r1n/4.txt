1. The premise mentions a woman walking down the street, but it does not specify her destination or direction, so her walking towards a bus stop is possible but not guaranteed.
2. Walking down the street could imply various potential destinations, including a bus stop, but the premise does not logically necessitate that she is heading specifically towards a bus stop.
3. The premise describes the action of walking but does not provide details about her intended endpoint, making the hypothesis about the bus stop neither confirmed nor refuted.
4. The action of walking in the premise is directionally ambiguous and does not logically imply that the woman is heading to a bus stop.
5. While the premise establishes that the woman is in motion, it does not logically connect her movement to a specific location such as a bus stop.
6. The semantic content of the premise allows for multiple interpretations of the womanâ€™s destination, with a bus stop being one of many possibilities.
