- The premise describes an older woman tending to a garden but does not confirm ownership; she could be a visitor or a hired gardener.
- The woman mentioned in the premise might be tending to a garden that belongs to someone else, such as a family member or a public garden.
- There is no information in the premise about the woman owning the garden; she could be helping a friend or working professionally.
- The premise lacks any mention of the woman having a garden; her actions do not imply ownership.
- The statement that the lady has a garden introduces an assumption not supported by the premise, which only describes her tending activities.
- The premise does not provide details about the garden's ownership, only about the woman's actions within it.
- The hypothesis assumes possession of the garden, but the premise simply observes her tending tasks without context on ownership.
- The garden could be a community garden, a shared space, or someone else's property, none of which are detailed in the premise.
- There is no evidence in the premise to determine if the garden belongs to the older woman or is merely a place she is working or visiting.
- The premise does not address the relationship between the woman and the garden beyond her tending it, leaving ownership ambiguous.
