1. Dogs swimming in a river does not imply they will swim across it.
2. Dogs could be playing or moving around in the river without swimming across.
3. The river could be too wide or have a strong current, preventing the dogs from swimming across.
4. The dogs might be swimming in circles or just floating, not necessarily crossing the river.
5. The dogs might be in the river for a short time and not have the intention or ability to swim the entire way across.
6. There might be obstacles in the river that prevent the dogs from crossing.
7. The dogs could be swimming near the shore, not attempting to swim across.
8. The dogs could exit the river at the same side they entered, not swimming across to the other side.
9. The term "swimming in a river" lacks directionality, so it doesnâ€™t specify crossing from one bank to another.
10. The context of swimming might involve a game or exercise, not a purposeful crossing of the river.
