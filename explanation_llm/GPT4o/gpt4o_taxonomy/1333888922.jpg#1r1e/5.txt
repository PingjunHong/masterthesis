1. The premise does not specify the time of day, so while it is possible the child is riding the swing during the daytime, it is not explicitly mentioned.
2. The sun breaking through the trees could occur during sunrise, sunset, or any time the sun is out, but the premise does not confirm that it is daytime.
3. The presence of sunlight does not necessarily imply it is daytime, as the sun can be visible during early morning or evening hours.
4. The premise describes a scene with sunlight and a child on a swing, but it lacks direct evidence that it is happening specifically during the daytime.
5. The hypothesis assumes it is daytime because of the sun, but the premise only mentions sunlight, which can occur at various times of the day.
