- The premise mentions people being busy but does not specify their actions, so the hypothesis about milling around is not directly supported.
- The term "busy doing their own thing" does not necessarily imply milling about; it could involve stationary activities.
- The premise does not describe the physical movement of people; milling about suggests a specific type of movement that is not mentioned.
- While people could be milling about, the premise focuses on their busyness, which does not explicitly support the hypothesis.
- The hypothesis assumes a specific action (milling about), whereas the premise only describes a general state of busyness.
- The premise's description of busyness lacks details about the nature of the activity, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
- The hypothesis introduces a visual image of movement that is not evident in the premise's description of busyness.
- Milling about suggests a leisurely or casual action, which may not align with the premise's depiction of people being busy.
