1. The two dogs in the hypothesis could refer to different dogs than those mentioned in the premise.
2. "Hiding" in the hypothesis implies an action that is not specified or confirmed by the premise.
3. "Stand" in the premise does not necessarily equate to the action of "hiding" in the hypothesis.
4. The reference to "the yard" in both the premise and hypothesis does not clarify whether the action of hiding is occurring.
5. The premise describes the dogs as "side by side," which does not imply the same state as "hiding."
6. The hypothesis implies an intent or action ("hiding") not evident in the premise's description of their stance.
7. The phrase "side by side" in the premise does not resolve the reference to "together" in the hypothesis in the context of hiding.
8. The reference to "the yard" is consistent across both, but does not confirm the specific actions or conditions of the dogs.
9. "Stand" and "hiding" are actions that require separate contextual understanding beyond simple coreference.
10. The neutrality arises because the coreference of "two dogs" does not imply identical scenarios in both sentences.
