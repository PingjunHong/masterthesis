1. "Two dogs hiding in the yard together" does not syntactically rephrase "Two dogs stand side by side in the yard" because "hiding" implies concealment, which is not present in "stand side by side."
2. The phrase "stand side by side" suggests visibility and openness, whereas "hiding" implies an attempt to remain unseen, creating a structural difference in meaning.
3. "In the yard" is used in both the premise and hypothesis, but the action described ("stand" vs. "hiding") changes the interpretation, preventing a structural rephrasing.
4. The premise uses a present simple structure to describe the dogs' position, while the hypothesis implies a different state or action by using "hiding," which alters the syntactic meaning.
5. The premise indicates the dogs' location and action ("stand"), whereas the hypothesis suggests a different action ("hiding"), making them structurally distinct rather than rephrasings.
6. Both statements involve two dogs and the yard, but the syntactic structure involving "hiding" versus "standing side by side" shifts the focus from visibility to concealment.
7. "Hiding" introduces a new element of behavior not implied in the premise's structure "stand side by side," resulting in a syntactic mismatch rather than a rephrasing.
