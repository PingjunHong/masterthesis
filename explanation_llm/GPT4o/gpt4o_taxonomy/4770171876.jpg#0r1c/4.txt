1. If the boy is playing on playground equipment, he cannot be sitting on a school bus at the same time due to the spatial separation.
2. Playing typically involves movement and activity, which contradicts being seated on a school bus, a stationary position.
3. Playground equipment is found outdoors, whereas a school bus is typically an enclosed vehicle, indicating different environments.
4. The activity of playing on playground equipment suggests recreation or leisure, whereas sitting on a school bus implies transit or travel, representing different contexts.
5. The premise describes the boy's clothing and setting, which are consistent with being outdoors at a playground, not inside a school bus.
6. The act of playing implies physical engagement with equipment, which is incompatible with the passive state of sitting on a bus.
7. Playground equipment is associated with a playground, not a school bus, indicating a contradiction in the location.
8. The premise suggests a current action (playing), whereas the hypothesis implies a different, simultaneous action (sitting on a bus), which is logically impossible.
