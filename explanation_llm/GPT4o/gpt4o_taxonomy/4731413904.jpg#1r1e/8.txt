1. It's common for bars to have televisions showing sports games, so it's reasonable to assume that some men watching TV at a bar are watching the sports game.
2. Bars are typical venues for people to gather and watch television, particularly sports events, which aligns with the premise.
3. The premise states that several men are at a bar watching a sports game on TV, which directly supports the hypothesis that some men are watching TV at a bar.
4. In a real-world context, watching TV at a bar often involves watching sports games, which is consistent with the scenario described in the premise.
5. The concept of watching television at a bar inherently includes scenarios where sports are broadcasted, making the hypothesis a logical extension of the premise.
6. The presence of multiple men at a bar watching a sports game on TV implies that at least some men are indeed engaged in watching TV, satisfying the hypothesis.
7. Bars are commonly equipped with televisions for patrons to watch, especially during sports events, which is a reasonable expectation given the premise.
8. The premise includes several men, which naturally encompasses the subset of "some men," thereby supporting the hypothesis.
9. In real-world settings, it's typical for bars to host patrons who watch television, particularly sports, thus the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.
