1. Pushing his cart up the street does not imply that he is selling food, as the action of pushing a cart can be associated with various activities, not necessarily selling food.
2. The premise describes an action (pushing a cart) without specifying what is in the cart or the purpose, whereas the hypothesis assumes the purpose (selling food), which is not structurally equivalent.
3. The premise mentions the person wearing a pastel print shirt and sunhat, but does not mention anything about selling or food, creating a structural mismatch with the hypothesis.
4. The premise focuses on the physical description and the action of pushing a cart, while the hypothesis introduces an additional element (selling food) that is not syntactically represented in the premise.
5. The premise describes a movement up the street, which can mean transporting goods or other purposes, whereas selling food specifically requires the presence of food and the act of selling, which is not syntactically aligned in the premise.
6. The structural focus in the premise is on the attire and action, contrasting with the hypothesis that adds an additional layer of meaning (selling food) that is not implied or rephrased from the premise.
