1. Jumping over an obstacle requires the dog to be airborne at some point during the action.
2. Gravity and the act of jumping inherently involve the dog being lifted off the ground temporarily.
3. The physical act of jumping necessitates that the dog is not touching the ground for a moment.
4. In the process of jumping, the dog propels itself into the air to clear the obstacle.
5. The trajectory of a jump includes a phase where the dog is elevated above the ground level.
6. Jumping involves acceleration that lifts the dog into the air, consistent with the laws of motion.
7. The definition of jumping includes being in the air as part of clearing an obstacle.
8. The natural sequence of jumping involves the dog being airborne as it surpasses the obstacle.
9. A successful jump over an obstacle means the dog is elevated, aligning with the description of being in the air.
10. The mechanics of jumping, involving lift and propulsion, inherently place the dog in the air.
