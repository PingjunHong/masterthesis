1. "The girls" is a plural form indicating multiple girls, which aligns with "girls" in the hypothesis, reflecting the same plurality.
2. "Walk down the street" in the premise is directly mirrored in the hypothesis, indicating the same action and context.
3. The removal of "the" before "girls" in the hypothesis does not alter the fundamental meaning, as it still refers to an unspecified group of girls.
4. Both premise and hypothesis describe the same action "walk," ensuring semantic alignment.
5. The phrase "down the street" is consistently used in both the premise and hypothesis, preserving the described location and direction.
6. The structure of the premise inherently implies the generalized statement in the hypothesis by omitting specific determiners without altering the core meaning.
7. The premise contains all the necessary semantic components for the hypothesis, ensuring no additional context is required for the statement to be true.
8. The transformation from "the girls" to "girls" maintains the logical implication that a group of girls is involved in the action described.
