1. A person in a red shirt and black pants hunched over contradicts the statement that the person is wearing a green shirt due to differing shirt color descriptions.
2. The description of the person's shirt as red is structurally rephrased as the person is wearing a green shirt, but they are opposing statements.
3. The assertion of wearing a red shirt is syntactically opposed to the claim of wearing a green shirt, highlighting a contradiction.
4. The premise describes the shirt as red, which is syntactically incompatible with the hypothesis that states the shirt is green.
5. The color of the shirt in the premise (red) directly negates the color of the shirt in the hypothesis (green) through syntactic contrast.
6. The structural rephrasing from red shirt in the premise to green shirt in the hypothesis results in a contradiction due to color mismatch.
7. Syntactic alternation from red to green in describing the shirt results in contradictory statements about the shirt color.
