1. The premise states that the person is wearing a red shirt, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that the person is wearing a green shirt.
2. The color of the shirt in the premise is red, indicating that the shirt cannot simultaneously be green as suggested in the hypothesis.
3. A red shirt, as mentioned in the premise, logically excludes the possibility of the shirt being green, making the hypothesis contradictory.
4. Wearing a red shirt means it is not possible for the shirt to be green, as per the semantic interpretation of color terms.
5. The description of the shirt color in the premise (red) cannot logically align with the hypothesis description (green), leading to a contradiction.
6. The structure of the premise, which includes the color red for the shirt, inherently disputes the green shirt claim in the hypothesis.
7. The text specifies the shirt color as red, which contradicts the hypothesis that asserts the shirt is green.
8. The semantic meaning of "red shirt" in the premise logically negates the possibility of a "green shirt" as indicated in the hypothesis.
