- There is no information in the premise about the size of the fire, which means it could be large, but it is not confirmed.
- The statement introduces a detail about the fire's size that is not mentioned in the premise.
- The premise only indicates that a man is holding a torch of fire, but it does not provide any information about the fire's magnitude.
- While the fire could be large, the premise does not give any evidence to support this claim.
- The hypothesis adds information about the size of the fire that is not present in the premise, leaving room for multiple interpretations.
- The premise does not provide any details regarding the fire's size, so assuming it is large is speculative.
- The fire's size is not discussed in the premise, meaning the statement about it being large is neither confirmed nor denied.
