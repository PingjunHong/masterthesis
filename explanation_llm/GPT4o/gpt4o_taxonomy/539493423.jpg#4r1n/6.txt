2. The premise does not specify the fire's size, allowing for both large and small interpretations.

4. Without details on the fire's dimensions in the premise, the hypothesis about its size is neither supported nor contradicted.
5. The premise does not contain any quantifiers or measurements to confirm or deny the hypothesis regarding the fire's largeness.
6. The premise lacks specific comparative or quantitative indicators to assess the fire's size relative to a standard or expectation.
7. The hypothesis introduces a subjective assessment ("large") that is not inherently addressed by the premise.
8. The premise provides no context or reference point for evaluating the fire's size as large or small.
9. No explicit logical or structural element in the premise dictates the fire's size, leaving the hypothesis plausible but unproven.
