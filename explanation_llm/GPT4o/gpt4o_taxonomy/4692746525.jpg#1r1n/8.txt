1. Being a frowning old man in a military cap does not necessarily indicate that he is a military veteran.
2. The man's frown does not imply anger; he could be frowning for reasons unrelated to the protest.
3. Wearing a military cap does not confirm his stance or feelings about the war or the protest.
4. The presence of signs and balloons does not specifically indicate a war protest.
5. There is no direct evidence from the premise that the man is watching the protest with anger.
6. The civilian suit suggests he may not currently be affiliated with the military, affecting the assumption of him being a veteran.
7. The crowd could be gathered for reasons other than a protest, and the man's presence does not confirm his participation or support of any protest activity.
8. The premise lacks any mention of a war or protest, so the hypothesis about protesting the war is speculative.
9. The man's attire and demeanor do not provide enough information to determine his emotions or opinions about the crowd's activities.
10. The presence of balloons might suggest a celebration or festival rather than a protest, making the hypothesis uncertain.
