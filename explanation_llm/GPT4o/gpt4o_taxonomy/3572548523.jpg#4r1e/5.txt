1. The premise does not specify whether the couple is romantically involved, so the hypothesis could be true but is not explicitly supported by the premise.
2. The premise mentions "hand in hand," which implies walking together, but the hypothesis does not specify this detail, leaving room for interpretation.
3. The premise does not indicate the location or context of the street, which could affect the interpretation of "walking together."
4. The premise does not provide information about the couple's relationship status, which could influence the meaning of "together" in the hypothesis.
5. The premise does not mention whether the couple is engaged in conversation or silent, which could change the interpretation of "together."
6. The premise lacks details about their destination or purpose, so while they are physically together, their intentions are not clear.
7. The premise does not describe their emotional state, which affects the context of "walking together" beyond the physical act.
8. The premise does not specify if they are walking at the same pace or in perfect synchronization, which could impact the interpretation of "together."
9. The premise does not mention if they are aware of each other, which would influence whether they are truly "together" in the sense of mutual presence.
