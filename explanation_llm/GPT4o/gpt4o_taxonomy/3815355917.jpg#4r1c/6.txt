6. Convertibles are designed to be open-top, conflicting with the description of a car loaded with items on top.
7. The concept of loading items on a car's top contradicts the absence of a solid roof in convertibles.
8. The statement assumes a closed roof to support items, which is contradictory to the nature of a convertible.
9. The premise requires a stable platform provided by a non-convertible car roof, contradicting the hypothesis.
