1. The older women in the premise are not specified to have glasses, so "women with glasses" in the hypothesis does not clearly refer to them.
2. The premise mentions "formally dressed" women, while the hypothesis does not specify anything about their attire, leaving it unclear if they refer to the same individuals.
3. The hypothesis mentions "bald women with glasses," but the premise does not mention glasses, creating ambiguity in reference.
4. The hypothesis could refer to any bald women with glasses, not necessarily those mentioned in the premise, as "glasses" is an unresolved reference.
5. The reference to "formally dressed" in the premise is not resolved in the hypothesis, which could imply different women.
6. The reference to "older women" in the premise is not resolved in the hypothesis, which might refer to women of any age.
7. "Two bald women" in the hypothesis might not be the same as "two formally dressed, bald older women" in the premise, due to the lack of reference to their attire and age.
8. The premise does not specify glasses, meaning the hypothesis's mention of glasses could indicate different individuals.
