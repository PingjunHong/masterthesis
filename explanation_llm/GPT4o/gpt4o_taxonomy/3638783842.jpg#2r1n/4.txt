1. The premise mentions the women are formally dressed, but the hypothesis does not specify their attire, leaving it unclear if they are formally dressed or not.
2. The premise states the women are older, but the hypothesis does not mention their age, so there is no information to confirm they are older.
3. The hypothesis includes the detail of glasses, which is not mentioned in the premise, so it cannot be inferred that the women are wearing glasses.
4. The hypothesis specifies "two bald women," which is consistent with the premise, but does not provide enough detail to confirm or deny the presence of glasses.
5. The premise and hypothesis both mention "bald women," but without further detail on attire or age, there is no direct logical implication that they are the same women.
