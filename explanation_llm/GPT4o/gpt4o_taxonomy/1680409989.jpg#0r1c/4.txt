3. The premise specifies the painting is of a woman, whereas the hypothesis describes a portrait of a monkey, which contradicts the premise's subject matter.
4. The premise involves painting on a white wall, while the hypothesis does not mention this, instead focusing on a different painting subject, leading to a contradiction.
5. The action in the hypothesis involves painting a portrait of a monkey, which is inconsistent with the premise stating the image is of a woman.
6. The premise does not specify the gender of the painter, contradicting the hypothesis that claims a woman is painting.
7. The premise describes an activity involving a person painting an image, contradicting the hypothesis where the painter is specifically a woman painting a different subject.
