- If four young girls are playing, then they are present, and if their playing occurs in the water, then they are in the water.
- The action of playing in the water implies that the girls are located in the water.
- The description of four young girls implies the presence of four girls, and their described activity in the water indicates that they are in the water.
- The number of girls is consistent in both statements, and the context of "playing in the water" necessitates being in the water.
- The phrase "playing in the water" logically includes the condition of being in the water.
- The premise specifies "four young girls," which directly supports the hypothesis of "four girls."
- The act of playing inherently includes the participants' presence, and the specification of water in the activity confirms their location in the water.
- If the girls are described as playing specifically "in the water," then their presence in the water can be inferred.
- The premise's mention of "four young girls" supports the same number of girls in the hypothesis, while the activity of playing in the water ensures their location aligns with the statement.
