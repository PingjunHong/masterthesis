1. The action of hitting a tennis ball inherently involves hitting a ball, as a tennis ball is a type of ball.
2. The activity described in the premise specifies a location (court) and type of ball (tennis) but does not contradict the more general action of hitting a ball.
3. The premise provides a specific context (tennis court) that logically includes the more general action described in the hypothesis.
4. Real-world understanding of tennis involves hitting a ball, thus the statement logically follows from the premise.
5. The premise is a specific instance of the action described in the hypothesis, where hitting a tennis ball on a court is a subset of hitting any ball.
6. In the sport of tennis, the primary action involves hitting a ball, so it is logically consistent that a boy hitting a tennis ball is indeed hitting a ball.
7. The premise includes all necessary information to confirm the hypothesis, as hitting a tennis ball cannot occur without hitting a ball.
8. Given the context of sports and games, hitting a tennis ball is a scenario that fulfills the condition of the hypothesis, where the object hit is a ball.
