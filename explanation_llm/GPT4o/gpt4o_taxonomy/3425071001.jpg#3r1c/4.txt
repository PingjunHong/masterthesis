The premise specifies that a boy is hitting the tennis ball, not a girl.
The subject of the premise is a boy, which contradicts the statement's subject, a girl.
The action of hitting the tennis ball is attributed to a male in the premise, while the statement attributes it to a female.
The premise and statement disagree on the gender of the person involved in the action.
The premise clearly states a boy is involved, making a girl's involvement impossible.
The semantic roles in the premise do not match those in the statement, leading to a contradiction.
The gender-specific noun 'boy' in the premise is incompatible with the gender-specific noun 'girl' in the statement.
The structure of the premise assigns the action to a boy, not a girl, thus contradicting the statement.
The semantic content of 'boy' in the premise logically excludes 'girl' from performing the action.
The contradiction arises from the differing gender identifiers between the premise and the statement.
