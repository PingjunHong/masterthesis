1. "Boy" and "girl" are antonyms, indicating different genders.
2. "A boy hits" contradicts "a girl is hitting" because they refer to different subjects performing the action.
3. "A boy" does not match "a girl" due to the difference in gender terms.
4. The premise specifies a "boy," while the statement specifies a "girl," which are mutually exclusive based on gender.
5. "Boy" and "girl" represent distinct gender identities, creating a contradiction.
6. The action "hits" in the premise is performed by a "boy," contradicting the statement where the action is performed by a "girl."
