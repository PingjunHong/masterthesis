1. Not all Ford cars are sedans, so the type of car making the turn is not definitively a sedan.
2. The premise does not specify the type of Ford car; it could be any model, not necessarily a sedan.
3. The premise mentions a right turn, while the hypothesis refers to turning a corner, which is a broader concept and does not specify the direction.
4. The statement about walkers crossing does not specify their location relative to the car's movement, so it might not match the specific scenario described in the premise.
5. The number of males is specified in the premise, but the hypothesis does not clarify how many walkers there are, which could be more or fewer than three.
6. The term "walkers" in the hypothesis is vague and does not specify gender or number, unlike the premise.
7. The premise provides the specific action of "making a right turn," whereas the hypothesis uses the more general term "turning a corner," which could involve different actions or angles.
8. The hypothesis implies a general scenario of pedestrians crossing during a car's turn, which is a common occurrence and doesn't rely on the specific details provided in the premise.
9. In the real world, many types of cars, including non-sedans, can turn corners, so the description in the hypothesis doesn't uniquely apply to the situation in the premise.
10. The hypothesis does not mention the specific context or setting described in the premise, such as the exact location or traffic conditions, which could influence the interpretation.
11. The hypothesis could apply to any number of similar situations involving different types of cars and pedestrians, not only the specific instance described in the premise.
12. The unstated assumptions about the type of car and the number of walkers in the hypothesis do not logically follow from the details given in the premise.
