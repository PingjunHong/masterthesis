- The premise does not specify the type of Ford car, so it could be a sedan or another type of vehicle.
- The direction of the turn is specified as "right" in the premise, but the hypothesis only mentions "turning a corner," which does not confirm the specific direction.
- The premise mentions "3 males," but the hypothesis ambiguously refers to "walkers," without specifying gender or number.
- The premise indicates the males are walking "across the street behind the car," while the hypothesis does not specify the position of the walkers relative to the car.
- The hypothesis uses the term "walkers," which could include individuals other than the ones mentioned in the premise.
- There is no information in the premise about whether the Ford car is a sedan, so the type of car is not confirmed.
- The premise does not mention "turning a corner," only that the car is making a right turn, so the hypothesis' description of the movement is not fully supported.
- The hypothesis does not mention the specific brand "Ford," which is mentioned in the premise, leaving the car's make unspecified.
- The premise does not state whether the car is maneuvering in a residential area or any specific location, which could affect the interpretation of "corner" in the hypothesis.
- The hypothesis lacks detail about the sequence of events, such as the exact timing of the walkers crossing relative to the car's turn, which is not clarified in the premise.
