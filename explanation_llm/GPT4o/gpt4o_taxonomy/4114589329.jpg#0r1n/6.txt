1. A sedan is a type of car, but not all cars are sedans, so it is unclear if the Ford car is a sedan.
2. The statement refers to a "corner," whereas the premise mentions a "right turn," which may not imply the same location.
3. The term "walkers" is used in the statement without specifying gender, conflicting with the premise's mention of "3 males."
4. The temporal aspect of "as walkers were crossing" does not specify the same timing as "walking across the street behind the car," leading to potential ambiguity.
5. "A Ford car" in the premise does not exclusively mean it must be a sedan, leading to possible logical exclusivity issues.
6. The number of walkers is not specified in the statement, conflicting with the mention of "3 males" in the premise.
7. The statement lacks specific details about the direction of the turn, which could lead to a structural logical conflict with the premise's "right turn."
8. The premise specifies "behind the car," whereas the statement does not specify the relative position of the walkers to the car.
