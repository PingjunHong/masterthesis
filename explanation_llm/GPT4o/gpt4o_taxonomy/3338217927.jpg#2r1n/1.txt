1. The term "a dog" in the premise does not necessarily refer to "a pet" in the statement, as "a pet" could refer to any animal owned by someone.
2. The premise mentions "a dog jumping for a Frisbee" but does not specify any interaction with "his owner," making the coreference between "a dog" and "a pet" ambiguous.
3. "His owner" in the statement does not have a clear referent in the premise, as the premise does not mention any owner or human.
4. The activity described in the premise, "jumping for a Frisbee," does not directly correlate with "a game of fetch," leaving the reference to "a game" unresolved.
5. "In the snow" in the premise is not referred to in the statement, leaving the context of the activity ambiguous and unresolved.
6. The premise does not clarify if the jumping is part of a game with an owner, so the reference to "enjoying a game of fetch" remains unspecified.
7. The phrase "a Frisbee" in the premise does not explicitly match the "game of fetch" in the statement, as the Frisbee could be involved in a different activity.
