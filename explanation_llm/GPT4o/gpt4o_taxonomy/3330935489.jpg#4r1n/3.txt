1. The premise describes the dog pulling a stick, while the hypothesis suggests a game of tug of war, which is not structurally rephrased from pulling a stick.
2. The premise focuses on the action of pulling a stick, whereas the hypothesis involves an interactive game, which is not a direct syntactic rephrasing.
