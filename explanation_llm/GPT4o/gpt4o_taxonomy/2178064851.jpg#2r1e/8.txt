1. Chest-deep ocean water implies the child is indeed located in the ocean, as the water surrounding them is identified as ocean water.
2. The presence of ocean water suggests the child’s environment is the ocean, not a pool or any other body of water.
3. Standing in water described specifically as "ocean" water directly supports the statement that the child is in the ocean.
4. The term "ocean water" indicates that the geographic location is an ocean, thus affirming the child’s presence in the ocean.
5. Real-world knowledge of oceans being large bodies of saltwater confirms that if a child is standing in chest-deep ocean water, they must be in the ocean.
6. The description of the water as "chest deep" and "ocean" suggests typical ocean conditions, confirming the child's location in the oceanic environment.
7. The concept of "chest deep" implies immersion in a large body of water, consistent with what is found in an ocean, thus supporting the hypothesis.
8. The reference to "a wet child" in "chest deep ocean water" aligns with the understanding that the child is immersed in the ocean, reinforcing the statement.
9. The premise specifies "ocean water," which inherently includes the child within the ocean's location.
10. Knowledge that oceans are the only places to find "ocean water" substantiates that the child is in the ocean.
