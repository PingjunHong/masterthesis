1. People often stand near buildings, and it's common for individuals to be in proximity to others, aligning with the description of a man near a building standing by two other men.
2. The premise describes a scene where a man is standing near a building, and two men are painting nearby, which matches the hypothesis of a guy near a building standing by two other men.
3. In the real world, when people are described as being "to the side," they are often within a close proximity, supporting the hypothesis that the men are standing by each other.
4. "Standing by" can mean being nearby or in the vicinity, which is consistent with the premise where the man is near the building and the two men are painting on the side.
5. It's common for individuals to use phones while standing, and this does not affect the spatial relationship described in the hypothesis.
6. The premise does not negate the possibility of the man standing by the two men, as it simply describes their actions and positions relative to a building.
7. Painting on the side does not imply distance from the man on the phone, allowing for the hypothesis that the guy stands by the two other men.
8. The causal activity of the two men painting does not interfere with the spatial configuration of them standing by the man on the phone.
9. The reference to "a building" in both the premise and hypothesis indicates they are part of a shared scene, making it plausible for the individuals to be standing together.
10. The scenario of people being in close proximity while engaging in different activities, like using a phone or painting, is common and supports the hypothesis.
