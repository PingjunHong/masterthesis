1. The premise mentions the girl walking in snow, which typically occurs outside, but the premise does not explicitly state that she is outside.
2. Snow can be found both inside and outside under certain circumstances, such as in a snow-themed indoor park, so the location is not definitively outside based solely on the mention of snow.
3. The premise describes the girl walking in snow, but it does not confirm that she is outside, only implying it through context.
4. There is no explicit mention in the premise that the setting is outdoors, leaving the possibility, however unlikely, that the snow is indoors.
5. Walking in snow generally indicates being outside, but without direct evidence in the premise, the statement about being outside is not directly supported.
6. The presence of snow suggests an outdoor environment, but since it's not explicitly stated, the hypothesis adds an inference not directly confirmed by the premise.
7. The premise does not specify the environment as outside despite the implication, providing no concrete evidence for the hypothesis.
8. Without an explicit mention of an outdoor setting, the hypothesis assumes information that is not directly stated in the premise.
