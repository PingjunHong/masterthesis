- The premise involves boys facing an incoming wave, but standing together is not explicitly mentioned, leaving room for interpretation.
- The term "group" in the hypothesis suggests a collective, but the premise does not provide evidence of a group configuration.
- The premise does not specify if the boys are standing, whereas the hypothesis assumes a standing posture.
- The premise does not mention whether the boys are interacting or standing together, which is assumed in the hypothesis.
- The premise specifies boys, but the hypothesis uses the non-specific term "people," which does not confirm the gender or age mentioned in the premise.
