1. The premise mentions playing in the leaves, which implies it could be Autumn, but does not explicitly state the season.
2. The hypothesis specifies Autumn, while the premise only mentions playing in the leaves outdoors without a specific season, making them not equivalent.
3. The structural transformation from "playing in the leaves outdoors" to "play in the Autumn" involves adding the specific season, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.
4. "Dressed as fairies, and are playing in the leaves outdoors" does not syntactically equate to "play in the Autumn" because the latter specifies time that is not mentioned in the premise.
5. The premise, "playing in the leaves outdoors," can occur in seasons other than Autumn, hence rephrasing it to "play in the Autumn" introduces new information.
