1. "Outdoors" does not specify a season, hence temporal neutrality with "Autumn."
2. "Playing in the leaves" can occur in multiple seasons, not exclusively in "Autumn."
3. The premise does not restrict the activity to any specific time or season, so "Autumn" is neutral.
4. "Dressed as fairies" is unrelated to seasonal timing, making no logical exclusivity with "Autumn."
5. The premise lacks any temporal indicator that would confirm or deny "Autumn."
6. No quantifiers in the premise specify a time period, leaving "Autumn" neutral.
7. "Leaves" could refer to fallen leaves, which occur in various seasons, not just "Autumn."
8. The premise does not mention "Autumn," indicating no structural conflict with its inclusion in the hypothesis.
9. "Playing" is an activity that can occur in any season, not exclusively in "Autumn."
10. Temporal neutrality arises as "outdoors" activities aren't limited to "Autumn."
