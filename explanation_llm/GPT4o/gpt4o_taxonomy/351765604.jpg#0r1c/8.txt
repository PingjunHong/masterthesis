9. The premise does not provide any information suggesting the presence of a garden or gardening activity, making the hypothesis inconsistent with the described scene.
10. Touching cracked earth indicates a focus on the condition of the soil, while planting a garden requires soil preparation and planting, indicating different intentions.
