1. "Rowboat" and "wooden object" are not necessarily synonymous; a rowboat is a specific type of boat that is often made of various materials, not exclusively wood.
2. "Ocean" and "water" are not synonymous; the ocean is a specific type of body of water, whereas "water" is more general and could refer to any water body.
3. "Group" and "bunch" can refer to similar concepts, but do not imply the same size or organization, leading to a neutrality in specificity.
4. The presence of "seagulls" in the premise is not addressed in the hypothesis, which omits this detail, making it neutral.
5. The premise specifies "surrounded by seagulls," which is not captured in the hypothesis, showing a lack of synonymy or negation that affects neutrality.
6. The premise specifies "in a rowboat," which implies movement or activity, while the hypothesis merely states "on the water," lacking the specific semantic meaning of being in a rowboat.
