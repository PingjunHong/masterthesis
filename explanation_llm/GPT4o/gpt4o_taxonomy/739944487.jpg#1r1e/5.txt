The premise does not specify the material of the rowboat, so it is unclear whether it is wooden or made of another material.
The premise does not mention the number of people, so "a bunch" could be more or fewer than actually present.
The premise specifies the location as the ocean, whereas the hypothesis only mentions "on the water," which could be any body of water.
The premise does not confirm the type of object as just "wooden," leaving room for ambiguity about the boat's construction.
The presence of seagulls is mentioned in the premise but not in the hypothesis, which introduces a lack of detail about the surroundings.
The term "bunch of people" is vague and lacks the precision provided by the premise, which simply states "a group."
The hypothesis does not provide any supporting evidence for the claim that the object is specifically wooden.
The premise describes the setting as the ocean, but the hypothesis does not explicitly support or contradict this, leaving it neutral.
