1. A land rover is a type of vehicle, so if a land rover is being driven, a vehicle is being driven.
2. Being driven across a river implies that the vehicle is crossing the river.
3. The act of driving across inherently means the vehicle is crossing the river.
4. "Across a river" describes the action of crossing, thus the vehicle is involved in crossing.
5. The term "a land rover" satisfies the broader category of "a vehicle," fulfilling the vehicle requirement in the hypothesis.
6. The phrase "being driven" indicates the motion necessary for crossing, implying the river is being crossed.
7. The premise specifies a river as the location, aligning with the hypothesis's mention of a river crossing.
8. The semantics of "driven across" logically imply a crossing event is taking place.
