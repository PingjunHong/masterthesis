1. "Men" in the statement refers to the same "men wearing blue uniforms" in the premise, but the actions described are contradictory.
2. "Men" in the statement and "men wearing blue uniforms" in the premise are the same group, yet the premise describes them sitting on a bus, not driving it.
3. The "bus" in both premise and statement is the same, yet in the statement it is driven into the ocean, contradicting the premise where men are only sitting on it.
4. The coreference of "men" in both sentences implies the same individuals are involved, but their described actions are inconsistent.
5. Resolving "men" as referring to the same group indicates that their role in the premise contradicts their role in the statement.
6. The reference to "bus" across both sentences involves same vehicle, yet the outcome of its use contradicts between sitting and driving into the ocean.
7. Same "men" implies a contradiction between their passive role in the premise and their active role in the statement.
8. The coreference of "men" wearing uniforms conflicts with the implication they are driving the bus into the ocean.
9. The "men" in blue uniforms cannot be sitting and simultaneously driving into the ocean, resolving the references highlights this contradiction.
10. The reference to "bus" being driven into the ocean contradicts with the premise where the men are merely sitting on it.
