1. Men sitting on a bus cannot simultaneously be driving it, as driving requires being in the driver's seat.
2. Buses are not designed to be driven into the ocean, as they are not amphibious vehicles.
3. If men are sitting on a bus, they are passengers, not drivers, and thus cannot drive the bus.
4. Driving a bus into the ocean would result in immediate danger and is contrary to normal driving behavior.
5. There is a lack of evidence or context supporting the idea that the bus could physically enter the ocean.
6. The act of sitting on a bus implies passive activity, incompatible with the active role of driving.
7. A bus entering the ocean would likely involve more than just sitting men, such as specific planning or equipment.
8. The usual purpose of a bus is for land transport, not aquatic travel, contradicting the notion of driving into the ocean.
9. Without any indication of malfunction or intentional harm, driving into the ocean defies standard transportation logic.
10. Standard bus routes and operations do not include destinations in the ocean.
