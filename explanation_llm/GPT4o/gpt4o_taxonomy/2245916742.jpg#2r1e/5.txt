- The premise mentions a man standing by face structures, but does not specify whether he is on Easter Island, although it is likely given the context.
- The premise does not clarify the man's exact location beyond standing by face structures, making it possible but not confirmed that he is on Easter Island.
- The premise provides no explicit statement about the man's location being Easter Island, only that he stands by two face structures.
- The premise does not mention any specific location, so the hypothesis assumes additional information that is not provided.
- The premise does not address whether the face structures are indeed on Easter Island, leaving the man's location open to interpretation.
- There is no direct assertion in the premise that the man is located on Easter Island, so the hypothesis introduces an assumption that is not explicitly supported.
- The premise omits any confirmation of the geographic location, so the hypothesis adds information about Easter Island that is not explicitly mentioned.
