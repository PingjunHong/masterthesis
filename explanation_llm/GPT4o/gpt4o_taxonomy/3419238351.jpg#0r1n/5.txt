1. The premise does not specify the relationship between the adults and the child, so it is unclear whether the child's mother is present.
2. The premise does not mention the gender of the child, so assuming the child is a son is unsupported.
3. There is no information in the premise indicating that the adults are friends.
4. The premise does not specify the gender of the child, so it is uncertain if the child is a girl or a boy.
5. The premise does not identify any of the adults as the child's mother.
6. There is no mention of the adults watching the child with a sense of familiarity or closeness, which would imply friendship.
7. The premise does not specify the number of adults, so it is unclear if there are enough adults to include the mother and her friends.
8. The premise does not state the purpose or nature of the adults' attention, so assuming a maternal figure and friends is speculative.
9. The adults could be any group of people, such as relatives, strangers, or caretakers, not necessarily friends of the mother.
10. The premise lacks information about the familial or social connections among the individuals present.
