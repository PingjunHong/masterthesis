5. The setting by the water suggests casual or beachwear, which a bikini fits, unlike a prom dress.
6. A colorful bikini and a prom dress serve different purposes and contexts, making them mutually exclusive in this scenario.
7. Bikinis are made for comfort and practicality at the beach or poolside, which does not align with the formal nature of prom dresses.
8. Wearing a prom dress by the water would be impractical and uncommon, supporting that the woman is not dressed as such.
9. The term "colorful bikini" directly contradicts the idea of a prom dress, which is typically a single-color formal attire.
