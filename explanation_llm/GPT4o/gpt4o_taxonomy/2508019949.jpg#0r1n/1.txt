1. "A person" in the premise does not specify age or gender, whereas "an old lady" in the statement specifies both age and gender.
2. The premise describes "a person" dressed in a floral dress with a stuffed bee, while the statement uses "an old lady," which may not refer to the same individual.
3. The premise does not mention the street being "busy," which contrasts with the statement's description of "a busy street."
4. "A baby stroller" in the premise does not necessarily equate to the "stroller" in the statement without further context about the stroller or the street.
5. The premise's reference to "a person" lacks the specificity needed to confirm it is indeed "an old lady," as stated in the hypothesis.
6. The premise focuses on the attire and specific actions of the person, while the statement generalizes with "an old lady," lacking explicit coreference.
7. The hypothesis introduces new information ("old lady" and "busy street") not present in the premise, making the references ambiguous.
8. The attire described in the premise (a dress with flowers and a stuffed bee) does not explicitly match the description of "an old lady," leading to unresolved coreference.
9. There is no direct mention of the person's age or gender in the premise to clearly resolve the reference to "an old lady" used in the statement.
