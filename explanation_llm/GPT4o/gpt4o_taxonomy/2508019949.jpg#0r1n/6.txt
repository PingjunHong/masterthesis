1. The premise does not specify the age of the person, so it is unclear if the person is an old lady.
2. The premise mentions "a person," but the hypothesis specifies "an old lady," creating a gender and age conflict since the premise does not confirm this identification.
3. The premise describes a street without specifying its level of activity, whereas the hypothesis describes it as busy, leading to a possible location conflict.
4. The premise includes details about attire and accessories (a dress with flowers and a stuffed bee), but the hypothesis does not mention these details, potentially affecting the identification of the person.
5. The premise does not specify the gender of the person, while the hypothesis assumes the person is female, leading to a gender conflict.
6. The premise and hypothesis differ in the level of detail provided about the surroundings, with the hypothesis adding an element of busyness not present in the premise.
7. The premise does not provide information about the age of the person, while the hypothesis makes an assumption about the person being old, creating an age conflict.
8. The premise does not specify any temporal context, while the hypothesis implies a situation that could be time-sensitive ("busy street"), leading to a potential temporal conflict.
