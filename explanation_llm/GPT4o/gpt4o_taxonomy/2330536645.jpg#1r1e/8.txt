1. Deep water is a natural environment where splashing typically occurs, so if kids are splashing, it is reasonable to conclude they are in deep water.
2. The description of the water as "deep" in the premise directly supports the claim in the hypothesis that the kids are in deep water.
3. When referring to water as "deep" in a general context, it is usually assumed to be deep enough for activities such as splashing, making the statement that the kids are in deep water a logical inference from the premise.
4. Real-world experience suggests that rock formations are often found near bodies of deep water, supporting the likelihood that the kids are indeed in deep water.
5. Assuming unstated information about the environment, such as the presence of a large body of water, it is plausible that the kids are in deep water, as indicated by their location near a rock formation.
