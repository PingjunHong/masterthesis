- A boy leaping into sand at a playground does not involve water, while doing a cannonball implies jumping into a pool of water.
- Leaping into sand occurs on solid ground, whereas a cannonball requires submerging into a pool, which is a body of water.
- The action of leaping into sand is distinct from a cannonball, which is performed by jumping into a pool.
- The premise describes an action in a playground setting, which typically lacks a pool, while the hypothesis involves a pool.
- A playground is typically not a place with a pool, making it impossible for the action described in the hypothesis to occur.
- The word "sand" in the premise indicates a dry playground environment, unlike a pool which contains water.
