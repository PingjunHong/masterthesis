1. The location conflict arises because the premise describes a playground, while the hypothesis describes a pool.
2. The activity described in the premise, leaping into sand, is structurally exclusive from doing a cannonball into a pool.
3. The logical structure of the premise does not allow for the existence of a pool, conflicting with the location mentioned in the hypothesis.
4. Temporal conflict occurs as the premise suggests a dry environment (sand), while the hypothesis suggests a wet environment (pool).
5. The premise specifies the activity as leaping into sand, which excludes the possibility of performing a cannonball into a pool.
6. The location exclusivity of a playground and a pool results in a contradiction, as the activities cannot coexist in the same space.
