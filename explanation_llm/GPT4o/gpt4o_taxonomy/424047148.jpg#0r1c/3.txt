1. The statement "The woman is blind" contradicts the premise because looking in a mirror implies that the woman can see, which is incompatible with being blind.

3. The act of looking in a mirror inherently requires vision, which contradicts the statement that the woman is blind.
4. The premise describes an action dependent on eyesight (looking in a mirror), which directly contradicts the claim that the woman is blind.
5. The phrase "looking in a mirror" indicates the use of sight, which is structurally inconsistent with the assertion that the woman is blind.
6. Observing one's own reflection through a mirror requires visual ability, contradicting the statement that the woman is blind.
7. The structural implication of "looking" conflicts with the state of being blind, as described in the hypothesis.
8. The description of the woman "looking in a mirror" syntactically relies on the ability to see, which is opposed to being blind.
