1. The premise specifies that the child is playing with her father's boots, which are typically larger and designed differently than a mother's shoe, indicating a contradiction in the type of footwear involved.
2. The premise involves the father's boots, which implies masculine footwear, whereas the hypothesis involves a mother's shoe, suggesting feminine footwear, thus contradicting the gender association of the footwear.
3. The premise describes the child interacting with boots, which are typically sturdy and utilitarian, while the hypothesis describes a shoe, typically lighter and more delicate, contradicting the type of footwear being played with.
4. The premise contains the word "father's," indicating possession by the father, whereas the hypothesis contains "mothers'," indicating possession by the mother, which contradicts the owner of the footwear.
5. The semantic structure of the premise and hypothesis both involve footwear but specify different types, "boots" versus "shoe," thereby contradicting the specific type of item being played with.
