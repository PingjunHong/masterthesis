1. The premise does not mention any construction occurring at the location, so the hypothesis introduces information not supported by the premise.
2. There is no mention of construction in the premise, thus the hypothesis adds details that are not present or implied in the original statement.
3. The premise describes a boy holding onto a wall but says nothing about any construction activity, making the construction detail in the hypothesis unsupported.
4. The hypothesis includes the occurrence of construction, which is not mentioned or entailed by the premise.
5. The premise focuses on the boy and the wall of the old brick house, without indicating any construction, which makes the construction detail in the hypothesis neutral.
6. The detail about construction is an additional element in the hypothesis that is not found in the premise, leading to a lack of supporting evidence for this claim.
7. The scenario of construction is introduced in the hypothesis but is absent from the premise, preventing the statement from being entailed by the premise.
8. The premise provides no context or evidence for construction taking place, thus the hypothesis remains a neutral statement due to the absence of mention.
