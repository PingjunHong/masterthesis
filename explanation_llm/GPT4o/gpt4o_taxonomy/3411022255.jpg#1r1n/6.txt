1. The premise does not specify the purpose of crossing the street, creating ambiguity about the destination.
2. There is no mention of 'home' in the premise, leading to a lack of clarity about the final location.
3. The premise does not indicate whether the crossing is connected to any specific reason, such as returning home.
4. The hypothesis assumes a purpose for the action that is absent in the premise, creating a logical gap.
5. The premise does not provide any temporal context or timeframe within which the crossing is occurring, leaving room for multiple interpretations.

7. The premise describes the action without any indication of intent or subsequent actions, such as reaching a destination.
8. There is no quantifier conflict between the premise and hypothesis, as both describe an unspecified number of people crossing.
9. The hypothesis suggests a future outcome (getting home) that is not mentioned in the premise, leading to a temporal mismatch.
10. The premise lacks any structural indications of exclusivity or requirements, such as 'must get home,' which appear in the hypothesis.
11. The premise provides a neutral description of the crossing without specifying any further actions or outcomes.
12. The hypothesis introduces additional context not found in the premise, such as a specific location ('home'), resulting in a logical structure conflict.
13. The premise does not restrict the crossing to any specific reason or location, leaving the hypothesis's assumption about 'home' unsupported.
