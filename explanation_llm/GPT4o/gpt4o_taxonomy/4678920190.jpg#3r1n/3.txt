1. The statement "People are outside in a park" implies an outdoor natural setting, which contradicts the premise of a "busy city" environment.
2. Being "in a park" suggests a green, open space, whereas "in a busy city" implies an urban setting, creating a contradiction.
3. The structural rephrasing from "a busy city" to "a park" changes the meaning from an urban environment to a more natural one, leading to a contradiction.
4. "Walking in a busy city at night" denotes an urban, possibly crowded setting, which contradicts the statement suggesting they are in a park.
5. The premise "A large group of people walking in a busy city" is inconsistent with the statement "People are outside in a park" due to the syntactic shift from "city" to "park."
6. The term "busy city" structurally contrasts with "park" in terms of setting, marking the statement as contradictory to the premise.
7. The context of "night" in a "busy city" suggests artificial lighting and buildings, whereas "in a park" suggests a more natural, open environment, thus contradicting structurally.
8. The syntactic elements "busy city" and "park" represent mutually exclusive environments, creating a contradiction in meaning.
