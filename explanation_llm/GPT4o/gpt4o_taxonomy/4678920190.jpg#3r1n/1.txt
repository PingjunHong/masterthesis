1. "People" in the statement refers to "a large group of people" in the content, but the locations differ between a "busy city" and a "park."
2. "Outside" in the statement is not specific to any location, but the content specifies "a busy city," contrasting with the "park" in the statement.
3. "A large group of people" in the content cannot simultaneously be in a "busy city" and a "park" as stated.
4. The reference to "at night" in the content does not correspond to any time-specific conditions in the statement, adding to the contradiction.
5. "Walking in a busy city" indicates a specific urban setting, which conflicts with the rural or natural setting implied by "a park."
6. "People" mentioned in both content and statement refer to the same group, but their described locations—"busy city" versus "park"—are contradictory.
7. The reference "at night" in the content does not align with any temporal context in the statement, which might suggest a different setting.
8. The word "outside" in the statement refers to being outdoors, but the context of being in a "busy city" contradicts the more serene setting of "a park."
