1. Ice can make roads slippery, but it does not inherently make a road dangerous for walking.
2. Icy roads can be navigated safely with caution and proper footwear, so danger is not guaranteed.
3. The presence of ice does not automatically imply that the road is perilous; it depends on other factors.
4. Walking on icy surfaces is common and can be done safely, so the road being dangerous is not certain.
5. The danger level of an icy road varies based on conditions and individual experience, so it might not be dangerous.
6. Ice on roads can be managed with care, reducing the likelihood of danger.
7. Ice is a common occurrence on roads in winter climates and does not always result in hazardous conditions.
8. Roads covered in ice can be traversed safely by taking precautions, so the danger is not definitive.
9. The concept of danger is subjective and can vary among individuals, so the road may not be dangerous to everyone.
10. The road's condition being icy does not automatically equate to it being hazardous; additional context is needed.
