1. The premise describes the road as icy but does not specify that it is dangerous, leaving room for interpretation about the level of risk.
2. The presence of ice does not inherently mean the road is dangerous; conditions could vary and be navigable with caution or experience.
3. The premise mentions four women walking, which implies they are successfully navigating the road, suggesting it may not be as dangerous as the hypothesis claims.
4. "Dangerous" is a subjective term that requires further details about the conditions, which the premise does not provide.
5. The premise does not indicate any difficulties or accidents, suggesting the road may not be dangerous despite being icy.
6. The hypothesis introduces the concept of danger, which is not logically derived solely from the fact that the road is icy, as stated in the premise.
7. The premise describes an action (walking) without comment on the difficulty or risk involved, whereas the hypothesis assumes risk.
8. The ability of the women to take a walk implies the road's condition allows for safe passage, contrasting the hypothesis's suggestion of danger.
9. The premise lacks any explicit mention of obstacles or incidents that would confirm the road's danger level, making the hypothesis an unsupported inference.
10. The hypothesis assumes that ice equates to danger, but the premise only states the presence of ice without further implications.
