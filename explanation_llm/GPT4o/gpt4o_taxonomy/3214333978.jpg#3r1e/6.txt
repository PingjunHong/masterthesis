1. The statement does not specify whether the road is dangerous specifically for the four women, as it could be dangerous for anyone due to the ice.
2. The premise mentions the women are walking on the road, but does not indicate any difficulty or danger, creating a temporal conflict with the hypothesis that suggests risk.
3. The premise does not provide any exclusive logical condition that must be met for the road to be considered dangerous, so the statement remains neutral.
4. The hypothesis introduces a subjective assessment of danger that is not quantified or restricted exclusively to the four women in the premise.
5. The structure of the hypothesis does not conflict with the premise because it allows the possibility that the road can be dangerous yet still navigable.
6. There is no explicit temporal marker in the premise suggesting the walk has not yet begun or is not ongoing, which would contradict the hypothesis claiming danger.
7. The premise does not state that walking on the icy road must result in danger, thus allowing for neutral interpretations.
8. The hypothesis implies a degree of danger but lacks exclusivity in its logical structure, allowing for alternative interpretations of the premise.
9. The premise does not provide exclusive or restrictive conditions under which the road must be deemed dangerous, thus avoiding a contradiction.
10. The hypothesis does not specify location-based restrictions that would inherently conflict with the premise, maintaining neutrality.
