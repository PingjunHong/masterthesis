3. The premise states that the girl is running and leaning over an object, directly supporting the hypothesis without contradiction.
4. Real-world knowledge suggests that a person described as "running and leaning" over something in the premise would be understood as "running and leaning" in the hypothesis.

6. The actions of running and leaning over an object are consistent with the hypothesis, as both describe the same person engaged in the same activity.
7. The premise includes all necessary elements mentioned in the hypothesis, making it logically sound according to real-world expectations.
8. Given that the premise and hypothesis both refer to a "tan girl" and her actions, the entailment is supported by the mutual context they share.
9. The assumption that a tan girl can perform actions such as running and leaning over an object is consistent with the scenario described in the premise.
10. The premise's detailed depiction of the tan girl's actions supports the unstated but assumed information that these actions are occurring, as stated in the hypothesis.
