1. Holding a torch of fire does not imply holding a bag, as the two actions involve different objects.
2. The phrase "holding torch of fire" cannot be structurally rephrased to mean "holding a bag" since they involve different items.
3. A torch of fire and a bag are distinct items; thus, holding one cannot be syntactically altered to mean holding the other.
4. The structure "holding torch of fire" describes an action with a torch, which contradicts the structure "holding a bag," describing an action with a bag.
5. Syntactic transformation of "Man holding torch of fire" does not equate to "The man is holding a bag" due to the difference in objects.
6. The action of holding a torch cannot be rephrased to mean the action of holding a bag, as they refer to different physical items.
7. Structural rephrasing involving "torch of fire" and "bag" leads to contradiction since they are syntactically and semantically different.
