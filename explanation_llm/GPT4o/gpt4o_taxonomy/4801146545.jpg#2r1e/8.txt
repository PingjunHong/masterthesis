1. People wearing white and red are still people, so if they are walking on a street, it logically follows that a large number of people are walking on a street.
2. The color of clothing does not change the fact that they are people, and hence, the premise directly supports the statement that a large number of people are walking on a street.
3. The specific colors mentioned (white and red) do not alter the truth that these individuals are indeed people, allowing the statement to be entailed by the premise.
4. Whether or not people are wearing specific colors does not affect the count or existence of people walking on the street, thus entailing the statement.
5. The premise describes a group of people, and since clothing color does not alter their identity as people, the statement is supported.
6. Knowing they are wearing only white and red is additional information, and removing this detail still leaves a large number of people, aligning with the statement.
7. The hypothesis focuses on the act of walking and the number of people, which is fully covered by the premise, despite additional descriptive details.
8. The fact that these individuals are described by clothing colors does not contradict or diminish their existence as a group of people walking, thus the premise entails the statement.
9. The presence of a large group is the main criterion for the statement, which is satisfied by the premise, regardless of the clothing description.
10. The premise provides a specific visual image but fundamentally confirms the statement by indicating a group of people, satisfying the entailment.
11. The act of gathering in large numbers on a street is unchanged by the color of attire, maintaining the truth of the statement.
12. The hypothesis is a generalization of the premise, where the specific detail of clothing color is unnecessary for verifying the number of people.
