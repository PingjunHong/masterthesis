1. In the real world, the action of getting ready to kick a soccer ball inherently requires the boy to be in a state of readiness, confirming that he "gets ready."
2. Kicking a soccer ball is a deliberate action that involves preparation and positioning, which implies that the boy is getting ready.
3. The phrase "gets ready to kick" logically includes the boy being in a state of readiness, as preparation is a necessary precursor to kicking.
4. Understanding that kicking a soccer ball involves a sequence of actions, it is reasonable to assume that the boy must first get ready, fulfilling the condition stated in the hypothesis.
5. In soccer, preparing to kick the ball involves a mental and physical readiness, which is included in the premise, thus supporting the hypothesis.
6. Real-world knowledge of sports activities indicates that before executing a kick, a player must get ready, which aligns with the statement that the boy gets ready.
7. The premise describes an action that inherently involves readiness, which directly supports the hypothesis of the boy getting ready.
8. The activity described in the premise presupposes a preparatory phase, confirming that the boy indeed gets ready.
9. Kicking a ball requires coordination and focus, suggesting that the boy has already reached a state of readiness as described in the hypothesis.
10. The sequence of getting ready and then kicking is a common and expected pattern, supporting the logical entailment of the hypothesis from the premise.
