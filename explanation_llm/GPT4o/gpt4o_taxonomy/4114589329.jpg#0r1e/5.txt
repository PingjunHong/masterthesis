1. The premise mentions "3 males" but does not specify them as pedestrians; hence, assuming they are pedestrians introduces information that is not explicitly supported by the premise.
2. The premise specifies "3 males" walking across the street, but it does not confirm their role as pedestrians, leaving room for other interpretations.
3. The hypothesis assumes the males are pedestrians without the premise confirming their exact activity or role on the street.
4. The premise does not provide explicit evidence that the males are pedestrians, as it only mentions them walking, which could be interpreted differently.
5. The premise describes "3 males walking" without explicitly stating they are crossing, creating a gap in evidence for the hypothesis's claim.
6. The hypothesis introduces the term "pedestrians," which is not explicitly mentioned or supported by details in the premise.
7. The use of "pedestrians" in the hypothesis assumes a specific role for the males that is not detailed in the premise.
8. The premise does not specify the distance or nature of the males' movement relative to the car, leaving the interpretation of them as pedestrians open to question.
9. While the premise states "3 males are walking," it does not affirm their direction or destination, making the pedestrian assumption unsupported.
10. The hypothesis assumes the males are crossing directly behind the car, while the premise only states they are walking across the street, lacking precise evidence for this exact positioning.
