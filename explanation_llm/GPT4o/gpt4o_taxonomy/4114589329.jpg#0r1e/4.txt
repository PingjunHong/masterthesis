1. A car making a right turn implies it is moving, and if it is moving, pedestrians can cross behind it.
2. If three males are walking across the street behind a Ford car, then the car had pedestrians cross behind it.
3. The presence of three males walking across the street behind the car indicates that three pedestrians crossed behind the car.
4. A Ford car making a right turn establishes the fact that it is a car, and thus the statement refers to a car making a right turn.
5. The action of "making a right turn" by a car coincides with the presence of pedestrians crossing, supporting the statement that they crossed behind.
6. The specification of "3 males" corresponds to the statement's "three pedestrians," indicating the same event.
7. The direction of movement described as "right turn" and "behind" suggests the spatial arrangement aligns with the scenario of pedestrians crossing behind the car.
8. The term "Ford car" in the content specifies the subject, which is generalized to "a car" in the statement, maintaining the logical structure.
9. The sequential actions of a car turning and pedestrians crossing behind it are logically connected, supporting the entailment.
10. The implicit logic that pedestrians cross streets aligns with the description of males walking behind a turning car, confirming the statement.
