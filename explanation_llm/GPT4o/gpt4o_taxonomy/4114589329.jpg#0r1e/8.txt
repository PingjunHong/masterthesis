1. The premise describes a Ford car making a right turn while three males are walking behind it, which directly supports the hypothesis that a car had three pedestrians crossing behind it.
2. The premise and the hypothesis both detail the same event of a car making a right turn with three individuals walking behind, establishing a direct causal link.
3. The fact that the premise states "three males are walking across the street behind the car" inherently implies that these individuals are pedestrians, aligning with the hypothesis.
4. The real-world understanding that people walking across a street are pedestrians supports the hypothesis that three pedestrians crossed behind the car.
5. The premise mentions "3 males," which is a specific instance of "three pedestrians," as males in this context are likely to be human pedestrians.
6. Cars making right turns and pedestrians crossing behind them is a typical scenario, making the hypothesis logically consistent with the premise.
7. The use of "Ford car" in the premise implies it is a type of car, which satisfies the broader category of "a car" in the hypothesis.
8. The premise includes the real-world scenario of a car turning and people walking, providing unstated but assumed information that these people are pedestrians.
9. Given that cars and pedestrians frequently interact in traffic scenarios, the premise naturally leads to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis without additional assumptions.
10. The action of crossing the street implies that individuals are pedestrians, supporting the hypothesis that pedestrians crossed behind the car.
11. The premise's description of the location and movement of the individuals as they walk "across the street" fulfills the hypothesis's condition of pedestrians crossing behind the car.
12. World knowledge dictates that if three males are walking across the street behind a car, they are pedestrians, fulfilling the hypothesis's criteria.
13. The premise and hypothesis both focus on the key elements of a car turning and individuals walking behind it, ensuring logical coherence between the two statements.
