1. The premise mentions singers, but does not specify that they are part of a chorus, which is typically a specific group performing together.
2. The term "performing" in the hypothesis does not necessarily imply a chorus, as singers can perform individually or as part of various other musical arrangements.
3. The presence of singers on stage does not logically imply they are part of a chorus, as singers can perform in various formats, such as solo acts or duets.
4. The premise describes the number and gender of singers but lacks information about their organizational structure, such as being part of a chorus.
5. The hypothesis assumes a specific performance setup (chorus) that is not logically deduced from the given premise, which only states the presence of singers.
6. The premise does not indicate a group performance style associated with a chorus, like harmonized singing or uniform attire, which would support the hypothesis.
7. The structure of the premise allows for multiple interpretations of the singers' arrangement, and does not exclusively suggest a chorus.
8. The semantic content of "singers on a stage" encompasses multiple performance types, and the hypothesis narrows it down to one possibility not inherently supported by the premise.
9. The premise and hypothesis both involve performance, but the hypothesis introduces an additional concept (chorus) that is not logically derived from the premise's details.
10. The logical implications of the premise do not extend to defining the singers' performance as a chorus, leaving the hypothesis without necessary structural support.
