3. The presence of a window and several paintings on the wall indicates an enclosed space, yet the premise does not explicitly confirm it as a room.
4. The hypothesis introduces the concept of "room," which is not directly stated in the premise, leaving its existence unconfirmed.
5. The premise describes a setting that is likely a room, but the hypothesis assumes this without explicit mention in the premise.
6. The woman lying on a yoga mat suggests an indoor environment, but the word "room" is absent from the premise.
7. While the premise implies an indoor scene, it does not categorically mention a "room," making the hypothesis unverified based on the text.
