1. The presence of two men in a boat implies there are people in the boat, as men are people.
2. A boat occupied by two men satisfies the condition of having some people in it since "some" indicates an unspecified plural number.
3. The concept of "some people" is logically consistent with there being at least two men in the boat.
4. In real-world terms, two men standing in a boat meet the minimal requirement to be described as "some people" due to common linguistic usage.
5. The word "some" does not specify an exact number, and two men qualify as some people, which satisfies the statement.
6. By understanding that "some" can mean any quantity greater than one, two men fulfill this requirement.
7. Assuming basic counting principles, two men naturally constitute a group of people, which aligns with the statement.
8. In everyday language, the phrase "some people" does not require specifying the exact number, and thus the presence of two men is sufficient.
9. The fact that two men are present in the boat inherently means that there is more than one person, which aligns with the term "some people."
10. The information that two men are standing in a boat means that the minimum threshold for "some" is met, as it implies more than zero people.
11. Causally, if two men are standing in a boat, it follows that there are people in the boat, satisfying the statement condition.
12. Given the premise, it is logical to conclude that "some people" are present because two men can be collectively referred to as people.
13. Using probabilistic reasoning, it's highly likely that if two men are standing in a boat, then the number of people present meets the requirement of "some."
14. The unstated but assumed information is that the term "people" encompasses any group of individuals, including two men, who are identified as such.
15. The concept of a boat with two men standing in it inherently implies the presence of multiple individuals, hence "some people."
