1. The orchestra setting implies there are multiple instruments being played, but the hypothesis focuses specifically on the violin played by the woman, which is consistent.
2. The premise specifies a woman, and the hypothesis maintains this gender consistency.
3. The location conflict is avoided as the woman is playing the violin within the orchestra setting mentioned in both statements.
4. The hypothesis does not introduce a different temporal element; it is consistent with the ongoing action in the premise.
5. There is no quantifier conflict as 'a woman' and 'a violin' are singular in both statements.
6. The structural requirement that 'only a woman is playing a violin' is not contradicted, as the focus is on one individual within the orchestra setting.
