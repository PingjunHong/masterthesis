1. The statement "Two men are fighting outside a bar" introduces an additional detail "outside a bar" that is not structurally rephrased from the premise "One man, wearing a blue jacket, is kicking another man, wearing a red jacket."
2. The premise describes a specific action, "kicking," while the statement uses the broader term "fighting," which is not a direct syntactic rephrasing.
3. The statement suggests an environmental context ("outside a bar") that is absent in the premise, indicating a shift in meaning rather than a syntactic alternation.
4. The premise specifies clothing colors ("blue jacket" and "red jacket"), which are omitted in the statement, altering the syntactic structure rather than rephrasing it.
5. The statement implies a mutual engagement ("fighting") whereas the premise specifically mentions one-sided action ("kicking"), illustrating a change in structural detail, not a rephrase.
6. The premise uses descriptive language about the individuals involved ("wearing a blue jacket" and "wearing a red jacket"), which is not mirrored in the statement, indicating a lack of syntactic rephrasing.
7. The statement broadens the scenario to include a location ("outside a bar"), which represents a syntactic addition not present in the premise.
8. The premise's focus on attire and action is more specific than the statement's generalized context and engagement, reflecting a difference in syntactic detail rather than a rephrase.
