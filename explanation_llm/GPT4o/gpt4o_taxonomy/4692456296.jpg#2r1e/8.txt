1. Walking along the side of a bridge inherently involves the act of walking, which both the mother and daughter are doing.
2. The action of walking along any structure or path, such as a bridge, logically includes the act of walking itself.
3. Given that they are moving along the side of a bridge, it is assumed they are engaging in the act of walking.
4. The premise specifies a location (the side of a bridge) for the walking, but the core activity of walking is explicitly mentioned, supporting the hypothesis.
5. In real-world contexts, movement along a bridge is typically achieved by walking, confirming that the mother and daughter are indeed walking.
6. Bridges are common structures for pedestrians to walk along, and the described action of moving along it implies walking.
7. The presence of the mother and daughter on the side of a bridge involves the unstated but assumed action of walking, as this is the typical means by which people traverse such areas.
8. The activity of walking is a fundamental part of moving along the side of a bridge, as there is no indication of alternative forms of movement being used by the mother and daughter.
9. Observing a mother and daughter on the side of a bridge suggests they are walking, as this is the most probable method for them to move together in that setting.
10. The entailment is supported by the natural assumption that to be alongside a bridge in the context described, they must be walking, as no other form of locomotion is implied.
