1. The premise mentions boys with their backs against an incoming wave, but it does not specify whether they are playing, just that they are present near the wave.
2. The premise does not mention an ocean, only a wave, so it's uncertain whether they are actually in the ocean.
3. The premise refers specifically to boys, not a group of people, so it is unclear if there are others present.
4. There is no indication in the premise that the boys are engaged in playing; they could simply be standing or observing.
5. The premise does not confirm if the location is an ocean or another body of water like a lake or sea.
6. The premise describes the boys' physical position relative to a wave but does not include activities or behaviors typical of playing.
7. The term "group of people" in the hypothesis implies more diversity than the premise, which only refers to boys.
8. The premise lacks information about the boys' purpose or intent, so it cannot support the hypothesis of them playing.
9. The presence of a wave does not inherently suggest recreational activity, so the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
10. The premise does not specify the context or setting, such as a beach or ocean, that would support the hypothesis of playing in the ocean.
