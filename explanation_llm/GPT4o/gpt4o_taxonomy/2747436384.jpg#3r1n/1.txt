1. "Their backs against an incoming wave" refers to the boys mentioned in the premise, but does not clarify if they are playing or just standing, making it unclear if they are part of a group playing in the ocean.
2. "A group of people" in the statement could include the boys, but the premise does not specify that the boys are engaging in play, leaving the relationship between the two statements neutral.
3. The premise describes "boys" and not "a group of people," which may imply a different composition or activity than described in the statement.
4. The term "their backs" in the premise indicates the boys' position relative to the wave but does not imply any activity involving play, thus not confirming the statement.
5. The statement's use of "play in the ocean" is not explicitly supported by the premise, which only mentions the boys with their backs to a wave, without indicating any action or group activity.
6. No direct mention of "playing" in the premise leaves ambiguity regarding the boys' actions, which prevents clear coreference to the group playing in the statement.
7. The premise only specifies "boys with their backs against a wave," offering no evidence of a larger group or play activity, which is needed to support the statement.
8. The premise does not mention "the ocean," creating a potential disconnect in location or activity between the premise and the statement.
9. "Boys" in the premise does not inherently equate to "a group of people," and there is no explicit information connecting them to the ocean or play.
10. The premise's description of positioning against a wave lacks context about whether the boys are part of a recreational group, leaving the statement about playing neutral.
