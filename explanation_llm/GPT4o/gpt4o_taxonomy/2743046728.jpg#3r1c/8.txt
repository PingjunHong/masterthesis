1. People cannot actively search for seashells while taking a nap concurrently.

5. A nap involves resting and inactivity, which is the opposite of the active pursuit of seashells.
6. It is logically impossible for someone to be both asleep and actively engaged in an activity like searching for seashells at the same time.
7. The premise describes an outdoor, conscious activity, whereas napping typically occurs indoors and in a resting state.
8. The premise suggests the girls are awake and engaged, while the statement implies they are asleep, creating a direct contradiction.
9. Real-world understanding dictates that one cannot be asleep and simultaneously perform an active search for seashells.
