1. Playing with Legos does not necessarily mean the activity is taking place outside.
2. Legos can be played with indoors, so the location of the play is not specified in the premise.
3. The premise does not provide any information about the setting being outdoors.
4. Boys playing with Legos can occur in various environments, including indoors, so the hypothesis is not definitively supported.
5. There is no causal link between playing with Legos and being outside.
6. The assumption that playing with Legos implies an outdoor setting is not supported by the premise.
7. Playing with Legos does not inherently suggest an outdoor activity based on real-world understanding.
8. The premise lacks details about the location, making the outdoor setting in the hypothesis speculative.
9. The activity of playing with Legos is commonly associated with indoor play, not exclusively outdoors.
10. There is no probabilistic reasoning to suggest playing with Legos occurs more frequently outside than inside.
11. The premise does not imply any environmental context, leaving the location indeterminate.
12. Playing with Legos is a versatile activity that does not confine the boys to being outside.
13. Without explicit information about the setting, the hypothesis remains a neutral assumption.
