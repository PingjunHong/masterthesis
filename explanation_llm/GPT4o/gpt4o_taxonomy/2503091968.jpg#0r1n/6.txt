1. "Almost hit" implies a potential event that did not occur, not conflicting with the premise where the child is already screaming.
2. The premise does not specify the reason for the child's screaming, allowing for multiple interpretations, including the possibility of screaming at a person who almost hit the cab.
3. The premise lacks information about any external interaction with the taxi cab, leaving the hypothesis as a possible scenario.
4. The location of the person who almost hit the taxi cab is unspecified, creating room for neutrality regarding whether the child is screaming at them.
5. Temporal order is not fixed; the screaming could occur either before, during, or after the near-miss incident, which does not conflict logically with the premise.
6. The premise does not categorically exclude the presence or actions of other individuals near the taxi, allowing for the hypothesis to be true without contradiction.
7. The premise does not mention the child's awareness of near-miss incidents, allowing for the hypothesis to be neutral regarding her reaction.
8. "0095 taxi cab" is not exclusive to any particular incident, leaving open the possibility of multiple interpretations of events involving the cab.
9. The premise does not specify the gender or identity of the person involved in the near-miss, allowing for neutrality in the hypothesis.
10. The premise does not indicate the direction or focus of the child's screaming, which could logically include screaming at someone outside the taxi cab.
