1. "Being driven" implies motion and control, which is consistent with "splashing water" as the vehicle moves through the river.
2. "Crossing a river" inherently involves the vehicle creating disturbances in the water, leading to splashes.
3. The act of "driving across a river" necessitates interaction with water, which naturally results in splashing.
4. The phrase "is being driven" indicates an ongoing action that aligns with the dynamic nature of "splashing water."
5. Crossing a river involves traversing through water, which is structurally exclusive to creating splashes, as no crossing would mean no splashes.
6. The logical sequence of "driven across" and "splashing water" reflects a consistent activity without temporal or structural conflict.
7. The description of the action as "being driven" and "crossing" suggests continuity, aligning with the continuity implied by "splashing water."
8. The vehicle's interaction with the river surface during crossing logically results in water being displaced, causing splashes.
9. The exclusivity of the scenario where a vehicle crosses a river necessarily involves some degree of water interaction, leading to splashing.
10. The ongoing action of "being driven" across a river entails a direct cause-and-effect relationship with water displacement and splashing.
