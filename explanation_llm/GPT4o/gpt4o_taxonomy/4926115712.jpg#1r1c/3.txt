1. "Two people are sleeping on the train" is structurally rephrased to indicate an action (sleeping) that is incompatible with "An old woman watches a man look down at some balls on the ground," where no sleeping or train is mentioned.
2. The premise involves a woman and a man engaged in specific actions (watching and looking), while the hypothesis rephrases this scenario into an unrelated activity (sleeping) and location (on the train).
3. "Two people are sleeping on the train" syntactically alters the premise's actions and setting by introducing a new context (train) and action (sleeping) not present in the original scenario.
4. The rephrasing of the activities and setting in the hypothesis does not maintain the meaning of the premise, leading to a contradiction.
5. Syntactic alternation, from watching and looking down at balls to sleeping on a train, shifts the meaning entirely, resulting in a contradiction.
