1. The premise mentions "people" while the statement specifies "men," which is a change in the subject, thus altering the meaning.
2. "Wearing only white and red" in the premise does not specify gender, whereas the statement specifies "men," resulting in structural rephrasing with different implications.
3. The phrase "people wearing only white and red" does not necessarily mean they are men, creating a syntactic alternation that does not preserve meaning.
4. The premise uses "people," a broader term, while the statement narrows it down to "men," which changes the scope of the subject.
5. The premise describes attire as "wearing only white and red," while the statement places emphasis on "men walking in red and white," which is a structural shift.
6. "A large number of people" in the premise versus "a large number of men" in the statement indicates a syntactic change that alters meaning by gender specification.
7. The arrangement of "wearing only white and red" versus "walking down the street in red and white" involves a syntactic restructuring that changes the focus from clothing to walking.
