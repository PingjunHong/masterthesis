3. The premise specifies "before a competition," which is consistent with the temporal aspect of "getting ready."
4. The premise implies a necessary preparation step that supports the general assertion of readiness in the hypothesis.
5. The hypothesis generalizes the premise without introducing any conflicting quantifiers or exclusivity.
6. There is no contradiction between the specific mention of female gymnasts and the general term gymnasts, as the former group is included in the latter.
7. The logical structure of preparation (warming up) inherently supports the state of readiness described in the hypothesis.
8. The premise details an activity that logically contributes to the state mentioned in the hypothesis, with no conflict in terms of activity sequence.
