1. White ducks are common and not typically considered rare, making it unlikely for a white duck to be a rare breed thought extinct.
2. Most ducks found in the wild today belong to common breeds and are not known to be rare or extinct.
3. There is no evidence suggesting that white ducks have been driven to extinction, as they are frequently observed in many regions.
4. A duck expanding its wings in the water does not provide any information about its rarity or extinction status.
5. The statement that the duck is a rare breed contradicts the common understanding that white ducks are widely seen and not endangered.
6. If a duck were a rare breed believed to be extinct, it would likely be a significant discovery warranting more than just a casual observation.
7. The premise does not include any specific identifying features that would indicate the duck is of a rare or extinct breed.
8. Extinct or rare breeds are often characterized by unique features, which are not mentioned in the premise involving a white duck.
9. The typical habitats for rare or endangered duck breeds are specific and often protected, unlike the general setting described in the premise.
10. Observing a duck in a common scenario like expanding its wings in water suggests it is part of a typical population, not one that is rare or extinct.
