- "People" in the hypothesis refers to the same "people" mentioned in the premise.
- "Jumping" in the hypothesis corresponds to "jump" in the premise, indicating the same action.
- "Outside" in the hypothesis is implied by "mountain crevasse" in the premise, which is an outdoor location.
- The reference to "a mountain crevasse" in the premise supports the idea that the activity takes place "outside" in the hypothesis.
- "On a rope" in the premise does not change the outdoor context implied by "jumping," making the hypothesis consistent with the premise.
- The word "people" consistently refers to the individuals involved in the activity described in both the premise and hypothesis.
