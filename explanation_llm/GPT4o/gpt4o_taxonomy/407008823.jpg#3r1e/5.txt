1. The premise does not explicitly mention the location being outdoors, so it could hypothetically be an indoor climbing facility.
2. The premise describes people jumping over a mountain crevasse, but it doesn't specify whether the activity is occurring outside or inside.
3. The premise does not provide evidence to confirm that the jumping is taking place outside, as mountain crevasses can be simulated indoors.
4. While it is likely that mountain crevasses are outdoors, the premise does not explicitly state this, leaving room for an indoor scenario.
5. The premise lacks any direct mention of the activity occurring outside, leaving the environmental context unspecified.
6. The premise focuses on the act of jumping over a mountain crevasse, but the hypothesis introduces the idea of being outside, which is not explicitly supported by the premise.
7. The existence of mountain crevasses can be replicated in controlled indoor environments, and the premise does not clarify the location.
8. The hypothesis assumes an outdoor environment, but the premise does not explicitly confirm this setting.
9. The premise does not contain any details about the surroundings or environment, which means the hypothesis could be true but is not definitively supported.
10. The premise is silent on the location context, thus not confirming whether the jumping is happening outside or inside.
