1. An icy road cannot be considered dry, as ice is inherently wet.
2. Walking near an icy road implies the presence of ice, which contradicts the notion of a dry highway.
3. An icy surface suggests cold and wet conditions, incompatible with the description of a dry highway.
4. The term "icy road" indicates a road covered with ice, contrasting with the idea of a dry surface on a highway.
5. Ice formation requires moisture, which is absent on a dry highway.
6. An icy environment suggests recent precipitation or freezing temperatures, which would not leave a highway dry.
7. The presence of ice on a road implies a lack of dryness, conflicting with the statement about a dry highway.
8. Ice typically results from cold weather conditions that would prevent a highway from being dry.
9. Walking on an icy road involves dealing with slippery surfaces, unlike a dry highway.
10. Roads described as icy are typically hazardous due to ice, which does not align with the safety implied by a dry highway.
