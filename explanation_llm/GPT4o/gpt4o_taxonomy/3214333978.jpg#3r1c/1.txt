- "Four women" in both the premise and the hypothesis refer to the same group of women.
- "An icy road" in the premise and "the dry highway" in the hypothesis refer to different surfaces, creating a contradiction.
- The premise describes the women walking on an icy road, while the hypothesis mentions a dry highway, indicating different walking conditions.
- The reference to "taking a walk down an icy road" contradicts the reference to "walking near the dry highway" due to differing road conditions.
- The icy road in the premise contradicts the dry highway in the hypothesis because they refer to different environments.
- "Down an icy road" implies icy conditions, which contradict "near the dry highway" as it implies dry conditions.
- The premise's "icy road" contradicts the hypothesis's "dry highway" because both terms describe the location of the same group of women in incompatible ways.
