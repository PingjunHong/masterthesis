1. If some dogs are running, then there must be more than one dog present, contradicting the statement that there is only one dog.
2. The use of "some" implies a plural number of dogs, which contradicts the singular "one" in the statement.
3. A deserted beach with some dogs running indicates multiple dogs, conflicting with the notion that there is only a single dog.
4. The premise suggests a group of dogs, while the statement insists on a solitary dog, which are mutually exclusive scenarios.
5. The semantic implication of "some" inherently means more than one, opposing the claim of just one dog being present.
6. The structure of "some dogs" involves a quantity that is greater than one, which is logically inconsistent with "only one dog."
