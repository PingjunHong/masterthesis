1. "Some" indicates more than one, while "only one" explicitly states a singular quantity, creating a contradiction.
2. "Some dogs" suggests the presence of multiple dogs, but "there is only one dog" contradicts this by asserting a single dog.
3. The premise implies multiple dogs with "some dogs," whereas the statement asserts a single dog with "only one."
4. The word "some" is incompatible with "only one" because "some" implies a plurality that "only one" negates.
5. "Some" and "only one" are antonyms in terms of quantity, leading to a contradiction between multiple and singular.
6. "Deserted beach" suggests an empty or near-empty location, but the presence of multiple dogs contrasts with the singular presence of "only one dog."
7. The use of "only" in the statement negates the plural implication in the premise's "some dogs."
