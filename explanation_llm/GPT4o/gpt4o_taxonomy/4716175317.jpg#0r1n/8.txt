1. Street markets can sell a variety of items, not exclusively fruits, so the presence of fruits is not implied.
2. The description of a street market doesn't specify the type of goods being sold, leaving the possibility open to a wide range of products.
3. The presence of buildings and a statue indicates an urban setting, but this doesn't inherently suggest the market specializes in fruits.
4. The mention of a crowd shopping doesn't specify what they are purchasing, so it doesn't necessarily involve fruits.
5. While fruits are commonly sold at street markets, there is no direct indication that this particular market sells them.
6. Urban street markets often feature diverse offerings; without explicit mention, fruit sales are just one possibility among many.
7. The scene of shopping at a street market provides no concrete evidence regarding the types of goods available, including fruits.
8. The presence of a statue and buildings suggests a city environment, which could host various market types, not limited to fruit markets.
9. The premise focuses on the setting rather than specifying product types, making the inclusion of fruits speculative.
10. In urban markets, the range of items can be extensive, and the premise doesn't narrow it down to fruits specifically.
