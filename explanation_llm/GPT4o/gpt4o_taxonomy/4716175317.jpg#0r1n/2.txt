1. The premise mentions a street market, but does not specify what is being sold, so the presence of fruits is not confirmed.
2. The word "market" implies the possibility of various goods, not specifically fruits.
3. The premise provides no information about the products available at the market, leaving the type of goods open to interpretation.
4. The mention of a "street market" in the premise does not inherently indicate the sale of fruits, as markets can vary widely in their offerings.
5. The hypothesis introduces new information about fruits that is not directly supported by the premise.
6. The premise describes the setting and activity (shopping) but lacks details about the specific items available for purchase.
7. "Shopping" in the premise is a general activity and does not imply that fruits are among the items being bought.
8. The premise does not contain any keywords associated with fruits, so the hypothesis remains speculative regarding the market's inventory.
9. The hypothesis could be true, but there is no semantic evidence in the premise to confirm the sale of fruits.
10. While a street market might sell fruits, the premise does not specify any products, resulting in a neutral stance.
