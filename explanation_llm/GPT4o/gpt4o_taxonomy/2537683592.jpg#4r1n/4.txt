1. The premise mentions men working along a wall but does not provide any information about the weather conditions, so there is no logical implication about it starting to rain.
2. The hypothesis introduces the condition of rain, which is not addressed or implied by the premise, leaving the relationship between the two statements indeterminate.
3. The activity of working along a wall does not inherently suggest or imply a change in weather conditions, such as rain beginning.
4. The structure of the premise focuses solely on the action of working, with no semantic elements connecting it to weather phenomena like rain.
5. The premise describes a static scene of men working, with no logical progression or causation that would introduce the occurrence of rain.
6. The hypothesis adds new information not logically derived from the premise's description, maintaining their semantic independence.
7. The presence of hard hats on the men implies a construction or safety context but does not logically connect to weather conditions such as rain.
8. The premise lacks any temporal or conditional markers that would support an inference about a change in weather, such as the onset of rain, which is mentioned in the hypothesis.
