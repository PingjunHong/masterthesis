1. The premise does not specify the gender of the individuals, so it is possible that one or both of them could be female.
2. The premise only mentions two people kite surfing, without any mention of their gender, leaving it ambiguous.
3. The hypothesis assumes the gender of the people, which is not mentioned or supported by the premise.
4. There is no information in the premise that confirms the gender of the kite surfers.
5. The premise lacks any reference to the gender of the individuals, making the hypothesis speculative.
6. The statement introduces a detail (both are males) that is not contained or implied by the premise.
7. Gender identification of the kite surfers is absent in the premise, so the hypothesis lacks supporting evidence.
8. The premise is silent on the gender of the kite surfers, leaving the hypothesis unsubstantiated.
