1. The premise mentions "two people" without specifying gender, so the hypothesis stating they are both males cannot be logically confirmed or denied from the text alone.
2. The semantic content of the premise is focused on the activity of kite surfing and the action of crossing by each other, which does not provide any information about the gender of the people involved.
3. The structure of the premise centers around the activity and interaction of the people, leaving the gender unspecified and therefore undetermined in relation to the hypothesis.
4. The term "people" used in the premise is gender-neutral, and there is no logical implication within the text that specifies the gender of these individuals as male.
5. There is no inherent logical connection in the premise that links the activity of kite surfing with the gender of the participants, making the hypothesis neither confirmed nor contradicted.
6. The premise provides a description of an event without attributing any gender to the participants, so the hypothesis introduces a detail not logically inferable from the given information.
7. The action of "crossing by each other while kite surfing" does not inherently convey any gender information, thus leaving the gender aspect of the hypothesis unsupported by the premise.
8. The language used in the premise is neutral regarding gender, and there are no direct or implied logical cues that can infer the specific gender of the individuals involved.
