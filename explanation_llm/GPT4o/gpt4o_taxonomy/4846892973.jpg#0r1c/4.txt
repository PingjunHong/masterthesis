1. If people are standing on a pier, then they cannot simultaneously be standing on a boat, as a pier and a boat are distinct structures.
2. The presence of a table and a pair of glasses in the foreground suggests a stable ground setting, which contradicts the instability associated with being on a boat.
3. A pier is a stationary platform extending into the water, whereas a boat is a movable vessel, indicating that being on a pier precludes being on a boat.
4. Standing on a pier implies being on land or a fixed structure, which is contradictory to being on a floating or moving object like a boat.
5. The spatial arrangement "on a pier" logically excludes the spatial arrangement "in a boat," as they occupy different physical spaces.
6. The semantics of "standing on a pier" inherently contradicts "in a boat," as the former indicates a fixed location onshore, while the latter suggests being on water.
