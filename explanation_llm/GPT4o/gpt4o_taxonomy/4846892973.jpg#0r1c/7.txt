A pier is a structure that extends into the water, typically used for docking boats, not as a boat itself.
Standing on a pier implies being on a stationary platform, not on a boat which is mobile.
A pier and a boat are distinct entities; people cannot be standing on a pier and simultaneously be in a boat.
The presence of a table and glasses on the pier suggests a stable surface, unlike a moving boat.
A pier is typically a fixed structure, whereas a boat is designed to float and move in water.
Being on a pier indicates being on land or a fixed structure, whereas a boat is a vessel on water.
The description mentions people standing on a pier, which contradicts them being in a boat.
A pier is commonly used for boarding boats or fishing, not for standing in a boat.
The setting described indicates a pier, not the interior or deck of a boat.
