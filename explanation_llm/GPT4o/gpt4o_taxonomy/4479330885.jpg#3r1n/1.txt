1. The term "younger people" in the premise does not clearly refer to "young people" in the hypothesis, as "younger" is a relative term and does not specify an age group.
2. The phrase "in front of a statue" in the premise does not resolve to "in a school courtyard" in the hypothesis, since the two locations are not the same and could be entirely different places.
3. The reference to "Several younger people" in the premise does not specifically indicate the same group as "several young people" in the hypothesis, as there is no explicit link between the two groups.
4. The location described as "a statue" in the premise does not corefer with "a school courtyard" in the hypothesis, and there is no indication that these refer to the same location.
5. The phrase "sitting in front of a statue" lacks a direct reference to the "school courtyard" setting, making it unclear whether the two phrases pertain to the same situation or location.
6. The use of "several" does not provide enough detail to confirm that the groups in the premise and hypothesis are identical, as "several" can refer to different numbers of people in different contexts.
7. There is no explicit link between the setting of "a statue" and "a school courtyard" that would allow for a coreferential understanding of the locations.
8. The reference to "younger people" might suggest a different age range compared to "young people," preventing clear coreference in terms of age group.
