2. The presence of numbers on shirts could indicate participation in any race or event, not necessarily a marathon.
3. There is no mention of the distance or nature of the event in the premise, so it cannot be concluded that it is a marathon.

5. The activity described in the premise could be part of a training session, a charity run, or a different type of race, not just a marathon.
6. The premise does not mention any marathon-related elements like a start line, finish line, or marathon-specific signage.
7. The premise does not provide any evidence of the event's length or duration, which would be characteristic of a marathon.
