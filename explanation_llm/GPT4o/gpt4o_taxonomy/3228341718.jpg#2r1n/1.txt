1. The "3 ladies" in the premise could refer to any group of females wearing numbered shirts, not necessarily participants in a marathon.
2. The "numbers on their shirts" might imply a competitive event, but it does not specifically resolve to a marathon context.
3. "Running" in the premise is ambiguous and does not explicitly connect to "marathon" in the hypothesis.
4. The activity of "running" does not inherently mean participating in a marathon; it lacks specificity to resolve the reference to that event.
5. The premise does not specify the context of the run, leaving "marathon" in the hypothesis unresolved.
6. The reference to "3 ladies" does not inherently convey their participation in a marathon, only that they are running.
7. The term "numbers on their shirts" could imply a variety of events or contexts, not solely marathons, thus making the hypothesis neutral.
8. Without explicit mention of a marathon in the premise, the reference remains unresolved in the context of the hypothesis.
9. The premise's description of "running" and "numbers" lacks the specific reference needed to resolve it as a marathon event.
