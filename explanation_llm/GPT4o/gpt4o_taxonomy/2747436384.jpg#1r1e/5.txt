1. The premise mentions that four boys are about to be hit by a wave, but it does not specify whether the wave actually hits them, so it could be assumed that the wave might hit them.
2. The statement implies that a wave will hit the boys, but the premise only suggests the boys are about to be hit, leaving uncertainty about whether the event occurs.
3. The premise describes the situation as "about to be hit," which implies the possibility but not the certainty of the wave hitting the boys.
4. The premise does not confirm the impact of the wave; it only describes the approach, leaving the outcome unspecified.
5. The statement assumes the wave will make contact, but the premise only establishes the wave's proximity and potential to hit.
6. The premise lacks explicit information about the wave's impact, allowing for the interpretation that the wave could hit the boys.
7. The statement's assertion of impact is not directly supported by the premise, which only indicates the imminent risk of being hit by the wave.
