1. The premise mentions two horses but does not specify their colors, so the hypothesis about the horses being brown cannot be logically inferred.
2. The color of the horses is not discussed in the premise, leaving their color indeterminate and making the hypothesis neutral.
3. The hypothesis introduces new information about the horses' color that is not covered by the premise, hence the statement is neutral.
4. Without any mention of color in the premise, whether the horses are brown or any other color remains an open question.
5. The premise focuses on the activity involving the horses, not their appearance, so the hypothesis about color does not logically follow.
6. The premise provides no details about the horses' appearance, making any specific color attribution unsupported.
7. The statement about the horses being brown is an additional piece of information not derived from the premise.
8. The premise describes the action of working on farm equipment and pulling, with no details about the horses' color, so the hypothesis is neither confirmed nor contradicted.
9. Logical structure in the premise focuses on the work context, leaving the color unspecified and unrelated to the activities described.
10. The semantic content of the premise lacks any reference to color, thus the hypothesis about the horses being brown remains neutral.
