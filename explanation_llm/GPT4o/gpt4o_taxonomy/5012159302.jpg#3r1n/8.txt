The premise mentions two horses but does not specify their color, so the hypothesis that they are both brown is not necessarily true.
The color of the horses is not mentioned in the premise, so any assumption about them being brown is not directly supported by the given information.
There is no information in the premise about the horses' colors, making the hypothesis about them both being brown a speculation rather than a deduction.
The premise does not provide details about the horses' appearance, including their color, leaving the hypothesis about brown horses unsubstantiated.
The color of horses can vary widely, and without specific information in the premise, the hypothesis about their color remains neutral.
The description of the farm equipment being pulled by horses does not inherently suggest any specific color for the horses.
The hypothesis assumes a specific detail (brown color) that is not addressed or implied by the given premise.
The premise focuses on the activity involving horses but does not offer any clues about their color, rendering the hypothesis as neutral.
Without explicit mention of horse color in the premise, any inference about them being brown lacks direct evidence.
The hypothesis introduces additional detail (horse color) that is not covered or implied by the premise, leading to neutrality in the inference.
