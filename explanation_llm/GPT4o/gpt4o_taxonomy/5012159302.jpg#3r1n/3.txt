1. The statement about the color of the horses does not rephrase or alter the structural meaning of the premise about men working on farm equipment pulled by horses.
2. The premise does not provide any detail regarding the color of the horses, so the hypothesis introduces new information that is not a structural rephrasing of the premise.
3. The hypothesis about the horses being brown is an addition rather than a syntactic rephrasing of the premise involving men working on farm equipment.
4. The structural rephrasing of the premise would involve details about the men, equipment, or the act of pulling, not the color of the horses.
5. The statement about the horses' color is a new detail and does not reflect a syntactic alternation of the premise concerning farm work and horses.
6. Coordination between the premise and hypothesis is absent since the color detail is neither implied nor structurally rephrased in the premise.
7. Subordination in the premise would involve details about the farm equipment or horses but would not extend to specifying their color, thus making the hypothesis neutral.
8. The statement introduces an attribute of the horses not mentioned or structurally rephrased from the premise, maintaining neutrality.
