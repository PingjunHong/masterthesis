1. "The girl is sitting on the grass" is a structural rephrasing that contradicts "Girl in red jumping up" because sitting implies not jumping.
2. "Sitting on the grass" inherently contrasts with "jumping up," as these actions are mutually exclusive in terms of bodily position and movement.
3. The structure "The girl is sitting on the grass" indicates a stationary position, which cannot be reconciled with the dynamic action described by "jumping up."
4. The syntactic structure of "sitting" contradicts "jumping," as one implies rest and the other implies active movement.
5. "The girl is sitting on the grass" involves a passive state, whereas "jumping up" indicates an active state, making them structurally incompatible.
6. "Sitting" represents a static action conflicting with the dynamic action of "jumping up," causing a contradiction through syntactic alternation.
7. The coordination between "sitting" and "jumping up" fails structurally, as these actions cannot occur simultaneously, resulting in a contradiction.
8. Subordination of "sitting" beneath "jumping up" fails as the actions are opposed in meaning, leading to a contradiction.
