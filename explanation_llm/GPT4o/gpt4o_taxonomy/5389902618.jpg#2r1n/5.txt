4. The hypothesis introduces the idea of a religious ritual, which is not supported by the information given in the premise.
5. The premise focuses on the visual aspects of the performance, not the cultural or religious significance.
6. There is no mention of any religious elements or symbols in the premise, so the hypothesis remains unverified.
7. The premise describes an activity involving women, streamers, and costumes, but does not specify if it is related to any religious practice.
8. The lack of details about the nature or context of the performance in the premise means the hypothesis cannot be confirmed.
