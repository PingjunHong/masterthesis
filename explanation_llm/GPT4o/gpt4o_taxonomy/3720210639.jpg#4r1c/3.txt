1. "Boy in midair on bicycle" implies that the boy is actively riding his bicycle, whereas "The boy is afraid to ride his bicycle so he lets it sit in the garage and collect rust" suggests that the boy does not ride his bicycle at all.
2. The image of a "boy in midair on bicycle" indicates action and use of the bicycle, which contradicts the statement of the bicycle being unused and left to rust in the garage.
3. The premise shows a scenario where the bicycle is being used, which is structurally opposed to the hypothesis where the bicycle is not being used due to fear.
4. Being "in midair on a bicycle" suggests a dynamic activity, directly contrasting with the inactivity implied by a bicycle "sit(ting) in the garage and collect(ing) rust."
5. The premise depicts a situation where the boy is riding the bicycle, which contradicts the hypothesis of the bicycle being neglected due to fear.
6. "Boy in midair on bicycle" structurally opposes the notion of the boy not riding the bicycle at all in the hypothesis.
7. The active engagement of the boy with the bicycle in the premise is structurally at odds with the idea of non-engagement presented in the hypothesis.
