1. Demonstrating life vest usage doesn't necessarily mean the flight attendant is standing in front of passengers, as the demonstration could be done from the aisle or using a video presentation.
2. The flight attendant could be positioned anywhere in the cabin where passengers can see the demonstration, not specifically standing in front of them.
3. It's possible that the demonstration is taking place before boarding or during a safety video, so the flight attendant may not be physically present in front of the passengers.
4. The demonstration might occur in different areas of the plane, such as near the exit rows, and not necessarily in front of all passengers.
5. The flight attendant could be demonstrating from an aisle seat or using a microphone and video screens, which doesn't require physically standing in front of passengers.
6. The phrase "in front of passengers" suggests a specific location, while the demonstration could occur in a broader context, such as through a recorded video or from a central location in the cabin.
7. The demonstration could be part of a pre-recorded safety briefing that doesn't involve the flight attendant standing in front of passengers at that moment.
8. The flight attendant might be demonstrating while seated or standing to the side, as long as passengers can see the life vest usage demonstration.
9. Passengers could be observing the demonstration on overhead screens, which doesn't necessitate the flight attendant being in front of them directly.
10. The act of demonstrating life vest usage is not inherently linked to standing in front of passengers, as it can be done in various formats or locations within the aircraft.
