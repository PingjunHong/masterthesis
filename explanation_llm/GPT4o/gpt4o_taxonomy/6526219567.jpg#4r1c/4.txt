1. If no one seems to be looking at the statue, then it implies that there are no people gathered around it, contradicting the statement that tons of people are gathered around the statue.
2. The premise suggests an absence of attention from people, which logically contradicts the statement that there is a crowd gathered, as a crowd would naturally imply attention.
3. The phrase "no one seems to be looking" implies a lack of people in the vicinity, which cannot coexist with the statement that tons of people are gathered, as a gathering would mean people are present and potentially looking.
4. The semantics of "no one seems to be looking" implies isolation or solitude, which directly contradicts the idea of a large gathering, as a gathering implies the opposite of solitude.
5. The logical implication of "no one" and "seems to be looking" suggests an absence or minimal presence of observers, which is incompatible with the presence of "tons of people" as stated.
6. The premise conveys a scenario of neglect or lack of interest, which is logically inconsistent with the statement that implies a significant interest indicated by a crowd.
7. If no one is looking at the statue, it suggests a scene devoid of attention or interest, directly opposing the statement that implies attention from "tons of people."
8. The structure of "no one seems to be looking" suggests an environment of emptiness, which directly contradicts the lively scene implied by "tons of people are gathered."
9. The semantics of "no one" in the premise rules out the possibility of a large number of people, creating a contradiction with the statement.
10. The premise implies a quiet or unnoticed scene, which cannot logically coexist with a scenario where "tons of people" are present, as the latter would create noise and notice.
