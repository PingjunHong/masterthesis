The premise does not mention whether the telescope is being actively used to observe anything, so we can't assume the man is actively looking through it.
The premise does not specify if the telescope is functional or just being looked at, so we can't conclude the man is using it.
The premise could describe a scenario where the man is merely holding the telescope without actually looking through it.
The premise suggests the man is near the telescope, but does not confirm his eye is at the lens, which leaves room for doubt about active observation.
The premise might imply that the man is inspecting the telescope, not necessarily looking through it to observe distant objects.
The premise does not clarify if the telescope has a lens cap on or off, so the man might not be able to look through it.
The premise does not indicate whether the man is familiar with using a telescope, leaving open the possibility that he is not looking through it properly.
The premise does not mention any celestial or distant objects being observed, which makes it unclear if the telescope is being used for its intended purpose.
