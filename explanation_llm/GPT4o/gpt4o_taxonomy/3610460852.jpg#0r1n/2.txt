1. The premise describes the woman as blond, but does not specify her hairstyle, leaving the possibility of various styles including a bun.
2. The premise does not mention any details about the woman's hairstyle, so her hair could be styled in any way, including a bun.
3. There is no information in the premise about how the woman's hair is styled, making the hypothesis about her hair being in a bun neither supported nor contradicted.
