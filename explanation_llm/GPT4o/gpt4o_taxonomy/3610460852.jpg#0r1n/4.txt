1. The premise mentions a blond woman but does not specify her hairstyle, so the hypothesis about her hair being in a bun is not logically implied.
2. The premise describes the woman's position and attire but provides no information about her hair arrangement, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
3. The premise includes details about the woman's shirt and location but lacks information on her hair style, making the hypothesis about a bun neutral.
4. The premise states the womanâ€™s hair color and shirt color but says nothing about how her hair is styled, making the hypothesis neither supported nor contradicted.
5. The premise describes the woman as standing behind a counter with no mention of her hair being styled in any particular way, which results in the hypothesis being neutral.
