1. "Near water" implies a specific location, confirming that the people are standing at a particular place.
2. The presence of a boat heading their direction suggests a temporal element of waiting or anticipation, affirming that the people are stationary.
3. Quantifier conflict is absent, as "the people" refers to the same group in both the premise and hypothesis.
4. No gender conflict, as "people" is gender-neutral and consistent in both statements.
5. The logical structure of "standing" is consistent with the premise, which states their position near water.
6. The premise's indication of location near water supports the hypothesis of the people being stationary at that location.
7. Structural exclusivity is maintained as there is no indication in the premise that the people could be in any other position than standing.
8. "Heading their direction" logically implies the people remain in one place, consistent with them standing.
