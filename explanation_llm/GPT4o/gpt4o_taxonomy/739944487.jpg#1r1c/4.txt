The premise describes people in a rowboat in the ocean, which logically implies they are outside, not inside.
The statement refers to people watching a hockey game indoors, which contradicts the premise's setting of being in a rowboat surrounded by seagulls.
Being in the ocean in a rowboat contradicts the idea of being inside, as a rowboat is an outdoor setting.
The presence of seagulls suggests an outdoor environment, conflicting with the indoor setting described in the statement.
People cannot simultaneously be in a rowboat in the ocean and inside watching a hockey game due to the distinct nature of these environments.
The premise involves an ocean setting, which is inherently outdoors, conflicting with the indoor setting of watching a hockey game.
The setting described in the premise (ocean) and the setting implied in the statement (indoors) are mutually exclusive environments.
Rowboats are used in water, typically outdoors, which contradicts the notion of being inside, as stated in the hypothesis.
