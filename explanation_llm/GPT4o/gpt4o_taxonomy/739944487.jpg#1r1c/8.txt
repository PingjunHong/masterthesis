1. Being in a rowboat surrounded by seagulls in the ocean means the group is outdoors and not inside.
2. Watching a hockey game typically requires being indoors, either in an arena or in front of a television, which contradicts being in a rowboat in the ocean.
3. The ocean environment is vastly different from the typical setting required to watch a hockey game, indicating the two scenarios cannot happen simultaneously.
4. Rowboats are used on water, while watching a hockey game requires land-based facilities, making it impossible for both activities to occur at the same time.
5. The presence of seagulls and the ocean setting strongly suggest an outdoor activity that is incompatible with the indoor activity of watching a hockey game.
6. The logistics of being on a rowboat in the ocean make it impractical for the group to be simultaneously watching a hockey game indoors.
7. Rowboats do not have the facilities or equipment necessary to watch a hockey game, which requires either a screen or being present in a rink.
8. The time and place required for a group to be in a rowboat surrounded by seagulls do not align with the typical conditions of watching a hockey game indoors.
