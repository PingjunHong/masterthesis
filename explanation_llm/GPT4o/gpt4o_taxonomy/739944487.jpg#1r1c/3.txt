1. Being in a rowboat in the ocean is structurally incompatible with being inside watching a hockey game.
2. The syntactic structure of "a group of people are in a rowboat in the ocean" contrasts with "a group of people are inside watching a hockey game," indicating contradictory locations.
3. The premise involves outdoor activity in a rowboat in the ocean, whereas the statement involves indoor activity watching a hockey game, rephrasing the location as contradictory.
4. The structural elements of "surrounded by seagulls" suggest an outdoor setting, which contradicts being "inside" watching a hockey game.
5. The coordination of being in a rowboat versus being inside reflects a syntactic alternation that results in contradiction.
6. Subordination of the premise's outdoor setting with "in the ocean" contradicts the indoor setting of the statement "inside watching a hockey game."
7. Rephrasing "in a rowboat in the ocean" as "inside" establishes a syntactic-level contradiction of environment and activity.
8. The structural rephrasing of "watching a hockey game" is incompatible with the premise's "surrounded by seagulls," indicating a contradiction in context.
9. The syntactic alternation between "ocean" and "inside" highlights a contradiction in the spatial setting of the events described.
10. The coordination of activities—rowing versus watching a game—demonstrates a syntactic-level contradiction in activity type.
