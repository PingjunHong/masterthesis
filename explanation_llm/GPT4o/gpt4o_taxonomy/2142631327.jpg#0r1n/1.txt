1. "Her child" in the statement does not specify the identity of the child standing with the woman in the premise.
2. The premise describes "a small blond child" without indicating that this child belongs to the woman, leaving the relationship ambiguous.
3. The term "her child" in the statement implies possession, which is not confirmed by the premise that only mentions a child standing with the woman.
4. The relationship between the woman and the child in the premise is not explicitly defined, making it uncertain if the child is indeed hers.
5. The premise provides no information about family connections, so "her child" in the statement might refer to a different child not mentioned in the premise.
6. The premise simply describes a woman and a child standing together without clarifying any familial bond, making the statement neutral.
7. The statement's use of "her" assumes ownership or relation that is not established in the premise.
8. The premise lacks any possessive pronouns or adjectives indicating that the child is the womanâ€™s, so coreference cannot be resolved to support the statement.
9. The phrase "her child" in the statement implies a specific relationship that is not validated by the premise's description.
10. The statement assumes a familial link that is not explicitly present in the premise, leading to neutrality due to unresolved coreference.
