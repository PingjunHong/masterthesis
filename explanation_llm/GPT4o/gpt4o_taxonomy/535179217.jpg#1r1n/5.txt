1. The premise does not specify the size of the boat, so we cannot conclude that it is large.
2. The color of the boat is not mentioned in the premise; hence, it might not be blue.
3. The premise only states there is a boat, and it doesn't indicate any specific characteristics like size or color.
4. The hypothesis adds information about the boat being large, which is not confirmed by the premise.
5. There is no mention of the boat's color in the premise, so the hypothesis introducing the color blue is unsupported.
6. The premise allows for the possibility of various boat sizes and colors, but does not specify them, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
7. The premise and hypothesis agree on the presence of a boat, but the additional details provided in the hypothesis are not corroborated by the premise.
8. The premise does not provide enough details about the boat to confirm or deny the attributes mentioned in the hypothesis.
9. The hypothesis assumes details about the boat that are not present in the premise, making it neutral.
