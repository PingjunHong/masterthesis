1. The presence of a boat heading in their direction does not specify the size or color of the boat.
2. Boats can vary in size and color, and the premise does not indicate any specific characteristics of the boat.
3. Without additional context, one cannot assume the boat is large and blue solely based on its direction towards the people.
4. There is no causal link between a boat approaching people and it being large and blue.
5. The description of the boat's direction does not inherently include details about its size or color.
6. Real-world knowledge suggests that boats come in many sizes and colors, and such information is not provided in the premise.
7. The premise provides no probabilistic reason to assume the boat is large and blue, as these are additional attributes not mentioned.
8. Unstated information about the boat's appearance is assumed in the hypothesis but not supported by the premise.
9. The premise lacks explicit mention of the boat's color and size, making such details in the hypothesis speculative.
10. The hypothesis adds information about the boat that is not required or implied by the premise.
