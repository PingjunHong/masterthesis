- The premise mentions two people on a dock, but it does not specify whether they are outside or inside, though docks are typically outside.
- The statement "people outside" is not explicitly supported by the premise since it only describes people on a dock without mentioning their exact location relative to being inside or outside.
- While docks are usually outdoors, the premise does not confirm that these specific people are outside, so the statement introduces information that is not directly stated in the premise.
- The premise does not provide details about the physical environment, such as weather or surroundings, that would confirm the people are outside.
- It is possible for docks to be part of indoor or covered areas, so the hypothesis that the people are outside is not definitively supported by the premise.
- The premise lacks information about the setting's exposure to the outdoor environment, leaving the statement "people outside" unverified.
- The statement assumes an outdoor setting, but the premise only provides a location (a dock) without specifying its exposure to the elements.
