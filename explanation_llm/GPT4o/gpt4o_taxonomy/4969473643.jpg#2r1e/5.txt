1. The premise does not specify the nature of the interaction among the people, so we cannot conclude they are hanging out together.
2. The premise only mentions people looking at the camera, which does not necessarily imply social engagement or leisure activity.
3. There is no information in the premise about the relationships or intentions of the people; they might just be coincidentally gathered in the same place.
4. The premise lacks details about what the group of people is doing beyond looking at the camera, so they could be there for any number of reasons unrelated to socializing.
5. The premise does not provide any context or activity that suggests social interaction; it only states their presence in an alley.
6. The people might be strangers or there for a specific purpose other than hanging out, which is not mentioned in the premise.
7. The premise does not indicate any signs of casual or leisurely behavior that would support the hypothesis of them hanging out together.
8. The people's expressions, body language, or any other social cues are not described in the premise, making it unclear if they are hanging out.
9. The premise does not specify any common activity or shared experience that would suggest they are spending time together socially.
10. The setting of an alley provides no inherent implication of social gathering, and the premise does not add any such context.
