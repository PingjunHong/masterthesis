1. The premise specifies "men," but the hypothesis uses the more general term "people," which includes men but is not limited to them; however, since the premise states they are men, the hypothesis is entailed.
2. The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts or extends beyond the premise, as both statements agree on the number of individuals and the scaffold activity.
3. The hypothesis does not specify any details that are absent in the premise, such as the type of scaffold or the activity, ensuring it remains within the entailment.
4. The premise explicitly mentions "men," and since "people" is an inclusive term that encompasses men, the hypothesis is fully supported by the premise.
5. The activity of climbing and the object being climbed (the wooden scaffold) are consistent between the premise and the hypothesis, with no additional, unsupported details introduced.
6. The premise's mention of "two men" automatically satisfies the hypothesis's reference to "two people," as men fall under the category of people, ensuring entailment.
7. The hypothesis introduces no new context or elements beyond what is described in the premise, maintaining the entailment relationship.
8. The use of "people" in the hypothesis is a broader term for "men," which does not introduce unsupported information, confirming the entailment status.
9. The hypothesis does not imply any additional actions or characteristics absent from the premise, which maintains its status as entailed by the premise.
