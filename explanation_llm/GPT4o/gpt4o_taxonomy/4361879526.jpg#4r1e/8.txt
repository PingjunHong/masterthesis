1. "Men" are a subset of "people," so the presence of two men implies the presence of two people.
2. The term "people" is a general term that includes "men" as a specific category, making the statement logically consistent with the premise.
3. Real-world understanding dictates that if there are two men, there must be at least two people present.
4. The semantic equivalence between "men" and "people" ensures that the premise logically leads to the statement.
5. In everyday language, "people" commonly refers to humans, which includes men, making the statement entailment.
6. The definition of "men" inherently satisfies the broader category of "people," supporting the statement as true.
7. Probabilistic reasoning indicates that the likelihood of two men not being considered as two people is negligible, thus supporting entailment.
8. Unstated but assumed information about the taxonomy of humans implies that "men" belong to the category of "people."
9. The causal relationship between identifying "men" and "people" confirms that the premise supports the statement.
10. Real-world knowledge of gender classification affirms that "men" are understood to be "people."
