1. The reference to "the women" in the statement does not specify their age, while the premise only describes them as "wearing dresses" and "dancing in the forest."
2. The statement "The women are older" introduces information about age not mentioned or implied in the premise.
3. The premise does not provide any age-related details about "the women," making the age reference in the statement unresolved.
4. The coreference of "the women" in both sentences does not entail any age distinction, leaving "older" unsubstantiated.
5. There is no information in the premise to determine the age of "the women," so the age reference is neutral.
6. Both the premise and the statement refer to "the women," but the premise lacks any context that supports or contradicts them being "older."
7. The premise describes "women" in terms of activity and attire, not age, leaving the "older" aspect in the statement without resolution.
8. The coreference is clear, but the premise does not provide age information to support the age assertion in the statement.
