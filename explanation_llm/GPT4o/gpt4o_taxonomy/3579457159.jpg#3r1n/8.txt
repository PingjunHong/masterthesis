1. The fact that the women are wearing dresses and dancing in the forest does not provide any specific information about their age.
2. Dresses and dancing are activities that can be enjoyed by women of all ages, so the premise doesn't suggest anything about the women's age.
3. There is no causal or probabilistic link between dancing in the forest and the age of the women.
4. The premise lacks any context or cues, such as references to age-related activities or characteristics, that would suggest the women are older.
5. Forest dancing is not exclusively associated with older women, so there is no assumed information that would indicate their age.
6. Without additional context or cultural references, it is impossible to determine the age of the women based on their actions in the premise.
7. The setting of a forest does not inherently suggest that the women are older, as people of various ages can dance in such an environment.
8. The attire mentioned in the premise (dresses) does not provide any specific clues about the age of the women.
9. The activity of dancing itself does not imply any age group and thus does not support the hypothesis that the women are older.
10. The premise and hypothesis are not probabilistically linked, as the action of dancing in the forest could involve women of any age group.
