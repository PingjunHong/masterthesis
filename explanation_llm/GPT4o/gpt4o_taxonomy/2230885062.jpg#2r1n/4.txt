1. The premise describes two women standing on the grass, but it does not mention any preparations for a picnic, so the action of "getting ready for the picnic" is not logically implied.
2. Holding a cup and saucer does not inherently suggest they are preparing for a picnic; it could be indicative of many other activities.
3. The premise does not specify any items or actions commonly associated with picnic preparation, such as packing a basket or laying out a blanket.
4. Standing outside on the grass does not necessarily imply a picnic setting; it could simply be a location choice without further activity implied.
5. The description of the women wearing dresses does not specifically correlate with picnic preparation, as dresses can be worn for a variety of reasons.
6. The holding of a cup and saucer does not provide enough information to infer a picnic context, as it could relate to many other scenarios, such as having tea outdoors.
7. The premise lacks any mention of intent or future actions, such as planning or discussing a picnic, which would be necessary to infer preparation.
8. There is no explicit mention of food, utensils, or other picnic-related items in the premise that would logically support the statement of preparing for a picnic.
9. The scenario described does not include any activities or elements that are exclusive to picnic preparation, allowing for multiple interpretations.
10. The absence of any forward-looking language or indicators of future events in the premise means the statement about getting ready for a picnic is not directly supported.
