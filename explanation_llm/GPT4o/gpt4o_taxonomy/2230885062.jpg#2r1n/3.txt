1. The premise describes two women standing outside on the grass, whereas the statement suggests they are getting ready for a picnic, which doesn't directly correspond to any specific action or condition implied by the premise.
2. The premise mentions one woman holding a cup and saucer, which is not directly related to the notion of preparing for a picnic as stated in the hypothesis.
3. "Standing outside on the grass" in the premise does not necessarily imply "getting ready for the picnic" as described in the statement.
4. Being "outside on the grass" while one holds a cup and saucer does not syntactically suggest that they are preparing for a picnic, which is the claim made in the statement.
5. The premise focuses on their current action, standing, while the statement implies a future intention, preparing for a picnic, which does not structurally rephrase the premise.
6. The structural elements of "are standing outside on the grass" differ from the structural implication of "are getting ready for the picnic" in the statement.
7. Holding a cup and saucer is a specific action in the premise that doesnâ€™t syntactically infer the broader activity of preparing for a picnic in the statement.
