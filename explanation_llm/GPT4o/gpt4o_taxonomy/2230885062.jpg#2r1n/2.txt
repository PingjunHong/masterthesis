1. The premise mentions standing outside on the grass, but does not specify any activities related to a picnic.
2. Holding a cup and saucer could suggest various scenarios, not necessarily preparation for a picnic.

6. The term "picnic" involves a specific social event that is not mentioned or alluded to in the premise.
7. While both mention "dresses," wearing a dress does not inherently imply participation in a picnic.
