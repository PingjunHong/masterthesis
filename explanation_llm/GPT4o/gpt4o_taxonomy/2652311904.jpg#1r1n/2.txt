1. The term "busy street" doesn't necessarily imply it is morning or during rush hour.
2. "Numerous people" interacting isn't the same as specifying the time as "morning rush hour."
3. "Going about their lives" doesn't specify the time of day, such as morning.
4. "Busy people" can be present at various times, not exclusively during "morning rush hour."
5. The premise describes a general scene without indicating it is "rush hour."
6. The presence of "numerous people" on a street doesn't confirm it is the "morning rush hour."
7. "Interacting" on a busy street doesn't necessarily coincide with the morning.
8. The phrase "going about their lives" is too generic to infer a specific time like "morning rush hour."
9. While the street is busy, the hypothesis infers specific timing not mentioned in the premise.
10. The premise does not mention "morning," which is a key part of the hypothesis.
