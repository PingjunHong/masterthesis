1. An old shoemaker implies someone who is significantly older than 16, making it impossible for them to be getting ready for their 16th birthday.
2. The statement about the shoemaker's 16th birthday contradicts the description of the shoemaker as old, as "old" suggests an age well beyond 16.
3. The term "old" suggests advanced age, which directly contradicts the notion of preparing for a 16th birthday, as a 16-year-old would not be considered old.
4. Describing someone as an "old shoemaker" inherently conflicts with the idea of them being on the verge of turning 16, which is an age associated with youth, not old age.
5. The concept of celebrating a 16th birthday is incompatible with the label "old," which indicates a much higher age than 16.
6. The phrase "an old shoemaker" structurally opposes the implication of youthfulness or adolescence that comes with celebrating a 16th birthday.
7. Being old and getting ready for a 16th birthday are mutually exclusive due to the significant difference in age implied by "old" versus 16.
8. The structural implication of "old" is at odds with the youthful milestone of a 16th birthday, presenting an inherent contradiction.
