1. "The shoemaker" in the statement cannot refer to "an old shoemaker" because an old shoemaker would not be getting ready for his 16th birthday.
2. The reference to "his 16th birthday" cannot logically apply to "an old shoemaker" as the description "old" implies an age much greater than 16.
3. "His" in "his 16th birthday" does not resolve with "an old shoemaker" since an old shoemaker would not be close to the age of 16.
4. The pronoun "his" in the statement suggests a young person, not aligning with "an old shoemaker" in the content.
5. The phrase "getting ready for his 16th birthday" conflicts with the reference to "an old shoemaker" due to the age implication of being old.
