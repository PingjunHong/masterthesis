1. "A woman wearing a white jacket with blue jeans" refers to the person described, and there is no mention of a dog, so the statement about a dog does not match the description of the scene.
2. "The back of a woman" implies the focus is on the person, and there is no reference to a dog, making the statement about a dog incorrect.
3. The reference to "a flock of birds" indicates the setting involves birds, not a dog, contradicting the statement.
4. The description involves "a woman" and "birds," with no indication or reference to a dog, contradicting the hypothesis.
5. Resolving references in the premise identifies only a woman and birds; there is no dog mentioned, making the statement false.
