- The fact that people are riding bicycles in the street and wearing helmets doesn't necessarily indicate that they are a group of friends.
- Wearing helmets while riding bicycles is a common safety practice and doesn't imply the relationship between the riders.
- The premise doesn't provide information about the social relationship between the bicyclists, so they could be strangers or acquaintances rather than friends.
- Riding bicycles in the street is an activity that can be done by individuals, groups of strangers, or friends, making the hypothesis plausible but not certain.
- The situation described in the premise could be a public event or a race, where riders are not necessarily friends but are required to wear helmets.
- The premise lacks explicit indicators of friendship, such as shared conversation, laughter, or interactions between the riders.
- In urban settings, wearing helmets is often a legal requirement, unrelated to the social dynamics among the cyclists.
- The hypothesis assumes a social relationship that is not explicitly supported by the premise, which only describes a shared activity.
