1. "No one" in the hypothesis refers to the same group of people mentioned in the premise.
2. The "group of people" in the premise is the same group referred to as "no one" in the hypothesis.
3. "Dancing together" in the premise directly contradicts "no one is dancing" in the hypothesis because "no one" implies the absence of dancing.
4. The reference to "a group of people" implies multiple individuals, contradicting the singular reference "no one" in the hypothesis.
5. "Together" in the premise suggests collective action which conflicts with the hypothesis's implication of inactivity through "no one."
6. The premise's mention of "a group" performing an action (dancing) contradicts the hypothesis's assertion that "no one" is performing that action.
