1. The premise does not specify that the boys are washing their hands, only that they use a wooden set of steps in the bathroom, so the action of washing is assumed but not directly mentioned.
2. While the premise mentions that the boys are in an adult-sized bathroom, it does not explicitly state that they are engaging in the action of washing hands.
3. The premise provides information about the boys, their soccer uniforms, and the setting, but it lacks explicit confirmation that they are washing their hands.
4. The action of washing hands is a reasonable assumption given the context, but it is not directly supported or stated in the premise.
5. The premise describes the setup involving the boys and the wooden steps, but does not explicitly confirm the action of handwashing, leaving it as a possible inference rather than a certainty.
