1. The premise does not indicate any movement towards a gym, suggesting the gymnast is already at a training location rather than traveling.
2. Being coached on bar skills implies the gymnast is already engaged in training, contradicting the idea of being en route to the gym.
3. The context of being coached suggests a static scenario rather than the dynamic action of traveling to the gym.
4. The presence of coaching implies the gymnast is stationary, likely in a training facility, rather than in transit.
5. Real-world understanding of gymnastics training indicates coaching typically occurs at the gym, not during transit.
6. The scenario described in the premise does not align with typical travel activities, such as walking or driving, required for being "on her way."
7. Being coached on bar skills requires gym equipment, which is unlikely to be available during transit.
8. The premise suggests a setting that is compatible with gym environments, not transitional spaces like roads or vehicles.
9. The coaching activity implies a current location, likely at a gym, where such training typically takes place.
10. The static nature of being "coached" conflicts with the dynamic action required to be traveling to a gym.
11. The scenario described involves direct interaction with a coach, which is unlikely outside of a gym setting.
12. Real-world inference suggests that coaching sessions are scheduled at the gym, not during travel to the gym.
13. The equipment necessary for bar skills is not portable, indicating the gymnast is at a fixed location, not traveling.
14. Coaching interaction requires focus and presence, which are inconsistent with the distractions of traveling.
15. The premise's description aligns with typical gym activities, not the process of going to the gym.
16. Logical reasoning suggests that coaching occurs at a location with necessary facilities, contradicting the notion of travel.
