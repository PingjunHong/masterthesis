1. The premise describes the gymnast being coached on bar skills, which implies she is already in a gym setting, contradicting the hypothesis that suggests she is on her way to the gym.
2. Being coached on bar skills typically occurs inside a gym, so the premise indicates her current presence in a gym, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis stating she is on her way there.
3. The act of being coached on bar skills suggests the gymnast is already engaged in an activity at the gym, directly contradicting the notion that she is still traveling to the gym.
4. The premise's focus on the gymnast receiving coaching implies she is actively participating in a gym activity, which contradicts the hypothesis that she is merely traveling to the gym.
5. The premise implies completion of arrival at the gym due to the ongoing coaching session, conflicting with the hypothesis suggesting an incomplete journey to the gym.
6. The presence of a coach providing bar skills training suggests the activity is taking place in a gym, making the hypothesis of her being on the way to the gym illogical.
