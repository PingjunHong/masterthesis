1. Riding down the road does not specify the mode of transportation, so the premise does not entail that the boy is riding a horse.
2. The premise mentions "riding down the road" which could involve a bicycle, skateboard, or other forms of transportation, not necessarily a horse.
3. The premise specifies "between two cows," while the hypothesis specifies "by two cows," which suggests different spatial arrangements.
4. The premise does not mention a horse, so the hypothesis introduces a detail not logically implied by the premise.
5. The premise describes the boy's position as "between two cows," while the hypothesis describes the boy as simply passing "by two cows," which does not necessarily indicate the same scenario.
6. The action of riding is mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis, but the premise does not specify the object being ridden, leaving the hypothesis as an assumption.
7. The premise does not specify any animal being ridden, so the hypothesis adds an element not logically derived from the premise.
8. The premise describes a road, but does not provide details about the setting that would imply the presence of a horse.
9. The premise does not specify the position or movement in relation to the cows that would necessitate riding a horse.
10. The premise's mention of "riding down the road" could refer to various forms of travel, and does not pragmatically infer horseback riding.
