- The premise does not mention any construction activity, only that the children are laying on the rug with bricks between them.
- There is no indication in the premise that the children are building anything specific, such as a brick furnace.
- The premise only describes the presence of wooden bricks laid out in a square, which does not necessarily imply the construction of a furnace.
- The activity of building is not mentioned in the premise; the children could simply be playing with or arranging the bricks.
- A square arrangement of bricks does not inherently suggest the intention to build a furnace, as the premise lacks details about the purpose of the bricks.
- The premise does not provide any evidence supporting the idea that the children are engaged in constructing something with the bricks.
- The type of structure or object being built is not specified in the premise, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
- There is no mention of any building tools or materials that might indicate construction in the premise.
- The premise lacks information about the children's intentions or actions beyond lying on the rug, so the hypothesis introducing a specific building activity is not entailed.
- The premise does not specify the material of the bricks beyond being wooden, which does not necessarily correlate with building a furnace.
