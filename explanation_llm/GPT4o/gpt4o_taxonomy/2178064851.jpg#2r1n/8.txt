1. The premise does not specify the child's gender, so the child could be a boy or a girl.
2. Being in chest-deep ocean water does not provide information about the child's gender.
3. There is no causal connection between being wet or standing in ocean water and being a boy.
4. The childâ€™s gender is not assumed or implied by the scenario described in the premise.
5. The premise lacks any gender-specific indicators that would suggest the child is a boy.
6. Real-world experience shows that children of any gender can stand in ocean water.
7. The wet child could be a boy or a girl, as both genders frequently engage in ocean activities.
8. The fact that the child is wet and in the ocean does not probabilistically suggest a male gender.
9. There is no unstated cultural or societal information linking ocean activities exclusively to boys.
10. The child's gender is not determinable solely from the description of the ocean setting.
