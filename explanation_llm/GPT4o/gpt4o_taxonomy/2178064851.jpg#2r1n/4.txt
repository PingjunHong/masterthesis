7. Without any gender-specific pronouns or descriptions in the premise, the hypothesis about the child's gender remains an unsupported possibility.
8. The premise is centered on the child's state of being wet and in the ocean, with no logical consequence regarding gender, keeping the statement neutral.
9. The semantic content of the premise is limited to describing the child's interaction with the ocean, with no embedded logical cues about the child's gender.
10. The premise provides no logical framework to derive the gender of the child, making the hypothesis about the child being a boy neither entailed nor contradicted.
