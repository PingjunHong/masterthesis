- The description of the man in the premise only includes a black tank top and a red plaid hat, and there is no mention of any football equipment.
- The premise gives no indication or detail about the man participating in a football-related activity that would imply the use of football pads.
- Clothing items specified in the premise do not include any protective gear such as football pads.

- The premise focuses solely on the man's attire being a black tank top and a red plaid hat, leaving no room for the additional item of football pads.
