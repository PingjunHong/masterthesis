1. The premise describes people standing near and on a large black square, but it doesn't mention whether they are waiting or doing something else.
2. There is no indication in the premise that the group is specifically waiting; they could be engaged in various activities.
3. The premise lacks information about the purpose or action of the group, so it's unclear if waiting is involved.
4. The premise doesn't specify the group's intentions or actions, leaving the possibility of them waiting unconfirmed.
5. Although standing could imply waiting, the premise does not provide enough context to support this assumption.
6. The premise does not mention waiting, so any assumption about the group waiting is unsupported.
7. Standing near and on a black square does not inherently suggest waiting, and the premise offers no further clarification.
8. The premise fails to provide details about the group's activity, making the hypothesis about waiting merely speculative.
9. Without explicit mention of waiting, the hypothesis introduces an idea that lacks direct evidence in the premise.
10. The premise's focus on location and description doesn't entail any specific action like waiting from the group.
