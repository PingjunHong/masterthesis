1. The premise describes an action (hitting a tennis ball) but does not provide information about the boy's skill level, so the statement about him being good at tennis cannot be inferred.
2. The action of hitting a tennis ball does not structurally imply proficiency or expertise, thus the boy's skill at tennis remains indeterminate from the premise.
3. The premise involves an activity (playing tennis) but lacks any syntactic or structural elements that suggest the quality of performance or skill level.
4. The statement about being good at tennis is a qualitative assessment not directly stated or rephrased from the action described in the premise.
5. The premise gives a factual account of an event, whereas the statement introduces an evaluative judgment, not reflected in the syntactic structure of the premise.
6. There is no syntactic transformation from the premise that equates to an assessment of the boy’s tennis skills; the premise merely states that he is hitting a tennis ball.
7. The structural components of the premise focus on the action and location, with no syntactic indication of the boy’s proficiency, thus leaving the skill level as neutral.
