1. The premise describes a homeless man, which contradicts the hypothesis's description of a rich man.
2. The action of pushing an overfilled shopping cart is inconsistent with the notion of holding a luxury item like a Rolex.
3. The semantics of "homeless" imply lack of wealth, which directly contradicts the notion of being "rich."
4. The premise involves a plastic shopping cart, a common item for someone with limited resources, contrasting with the luxury implied by "Rolex."
5. The word "homeless" suggests a state of poverty, which is in direct contradiction to the term "rich."
6. The activity of pushing a shopping cart filled with belongings is typically associated with homelessness, conflicting with the high-status symbol of a Rolex.
7. The premise implies resource scarcity, whereas the hypothesis suggests abundance, creating a contradiction.
8. The visual image of a homeless man pushing a cart does not align with the image of wealth and luxury suggested by "holding a Rolex."
9. "Homeless" and "rich" are antonyms, leading to a direct contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.
