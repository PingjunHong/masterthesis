1. The premise mentions three girls and a cake made of Peeps, but does not specifically mention the presence of any other types of cakes, so the statement is not directly entailed by the premise.
2. While the premise refers to a cake made of Peeps, it does not explicitly state the existence of a cake in a general sense, leaving the possibility open but not confirmed.
3. The statement "There are three girls and a cake" is not explicitly supported by the premise, as the premise focuses on the action of blowing out candles, not the existence of a cake.
4. The premise describes the action of blowing out candles but does not explicitly confirm the presence of just a cake; the emphasis is on the Peeps-made cake, which might not be a traditional cake.
5. The statement introduces the idea of a cake without specifying its type or nature, and while the premise mentions a cake made of Peeps, it does not confirm the general existence of a 'cake' as traditionally understood.
6. The premise does not mention the presence of any additional elements or details about the cake other than it being made of Peeps, so the statement's general mention of a cake lacks direct support.
7. The premise includes the detail of a cake made of Peeps but does not affirm the existence of a typical cake, thus leaving the statement unentitled without specific evidence.
