1. The premise does not specify the gender of the people, so the mention of men and women in the hypothesis does not conflict.
2. The type of lettuce is unspecified in the premise, so the mention of romaine lettuce in the hypothesis does not conflict.
3. The premise refers to "a group of people," which can include any combination of men and women, so there is no logical exclusivity regarding gender.
4. The location, "local street market," is consistent in both the premise and the hypothesis, so there is no location conflict.
5. The hypothesis provides additional detail about the type of lettuce and the composition of the group, but these details do not contradict the premise.
