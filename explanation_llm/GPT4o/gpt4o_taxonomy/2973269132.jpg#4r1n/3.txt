1. "A lioness closes in on its prey" does not explicitly state that the lioness is hungry; it implies a hunting activity but doesn't confirm the motivation.
2. The premise describes an action, whereas the statement makes an assumption about the lioness's internal state, which is not directly stated.
3. Structural rephrasing of "A lioness closes in on its prey" does not necessarily communicate hunger; it indicates pursuit but not the cause or reason behind it.
4. The premise focuses on the action of closing in, while the statement interprets this action as being due to hunger, which is an additional inference not present in the premise.
5. The sentence structure of the premise does not equate to the sentence structure of the statement; the former describes an observable event, while the latter suggests a possible cause for the event.
6. The structural difference between describing an action ("closes in on its prey") and attributing a reason for the action ("is hungry") means they are not rephrasings of each other.
7. The premise and the statement are syntactically different; the premise involves a physical action, while the statement assumes an emotional or physiological state.
