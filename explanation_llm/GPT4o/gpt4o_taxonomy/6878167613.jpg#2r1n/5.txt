1. The premise does not explicitly mention that the golfer is readying to putt the ball; it only suggests they are getting ready, which could involve various preparations before actually putting the ball.
2. The act of putting the ball is not explicitly described in the premise; it implies readiness but doesn't confirm the specific action of putting the ball.
3. The premise mentions getting ready to putt, but does not confirm the act of putting the ball itself, leaving room for other interpretations of the golfer's actions.
4. The premise does not provide evidence that the golfer is specifically readying to putt the ball, only that they are preparing to do so, which may involve steps beyond the immediate action of putting.
5. The premise describes the golfer's preparation on the green, but does not directly mention the action of putting the ball, allowing for a range of preparatory actions.
6. The lack of explicit mention of the golfer putting the ball in the premise makes the hypothesis unsupported as it assumes an action not directly confirmed by the premise.
7. "Getting ready to putt" indicates preparation but does not specify the completion of the action, so the hypothesis introduces an element not directly mentioned.
8. The premise describes the setting and the golfer's readiness, but does not confirm the specific action of putting the ball, leaving the hypothesis unsupported by explicit evidence.
9. The premise suggests the golfer is preparing, but the explicit action of putting the ball is absent, making the hypothesis unsupported.
10. The premise implies preparation for putting, but does not include the explicit act of putting the ball, leaving the hypothesis unmentioned.
