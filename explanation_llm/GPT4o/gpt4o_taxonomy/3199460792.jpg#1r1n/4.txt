1. The premise describes an action involving two golden dogs but does not mention or imply their relationship status as friends.
2. Passing a ball does not logically require or imply friendship; it is merely an action that can occur between any two dogs.

5. The concept of friendship is not directly addressed or implied in the action of passing a ball between the dogs.
