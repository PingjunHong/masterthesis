1. The statement "The dogs are friends" is not a structural rephrase of "A golden dog passes a blue ball to another golden dog on the beach."
2. The premise describes an action involving the dogs and a ball, but the statement about friendship is not a syntactic alteration or structural equivalent.
3. There is no syntactic alternation in the premise that directly implies the friendship between the dogs.
4. The coordination or subordination of actions in the premise does not inherently suggest the dogs' friendship.
5. The structural elements of the premise focus on the activity of passing a ball, not the relational status of the dogs.
6. The premise can be rephrased by emphasizing the action (e.g., "A golden dog transfers a blue ball to another on the beach"), but it does not change the neutral nature concerning friendship.
7. Any rephrasing of the premise regarding the dogs and the ball remains unrelated to the hypothesis about friendship.
8. Syntactic rephrasing would maintain the focus on the activity described, not the dogs' relationship.
9. The premise's structural rephrasing might include details about location or action but not relational dynamics like friendship.
