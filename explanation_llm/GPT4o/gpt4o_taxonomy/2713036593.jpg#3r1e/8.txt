1. The action of sitting on the floor while sleeping implies the man is indeed sleeping on the floor.
2. In the real world, if a person is sitting and sleeping, they are naturally doing so on the surface they are sitting on, which, in this case, is the floor.
3. The positional context provided by "sitting" inherently includes the floor when it is specified as the surface, confirming the man is sleeping on the floor.
4. General knowledge about human posture suggests that if someone is sitting on the floor and sleeping, their sleeping location is the same as their sitting location.
5. The premise explicitly states the man is already on the floor, and since he is sleeping in that position, it follows directly that he is sleeping on the floor.
6. Understanding of common human behavior indicates that if a person is seated on a floor while asleep, their sleeping position is the floor itself.
7. Assuming unstated real-world knowledge, a person cannot be sitting elsewhere while simultaneously being on the floor, so the statement logically follows from the premise.
