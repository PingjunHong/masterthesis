1. The premise mentions that the young man is looking at a skateboard park, but it does not specify his intentions or plans, so it is unclear whether he will go skateboarding today or at another time.
2. Observing a skateboard park does not logically imply that the person will skate today; he could merely be observing or planning for a future visit.
3. The premise describes the young man carrying a skateboard, but possessing a skateboard does not necessarily mean he will use it today; he may be carrying it for another reason.
4. The use of "today" in the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, as the premise does not provide any temporal information about when the young man might skateboard.
5. While the young man is dressed in attire typically associated with skateboarding, the premise does not explicitly state his intentions, thus leaving open the possibility that he may engage in other activities.
6. The premise provides no information about the young man's schedule or plans for the day, so the inference that he will skateboard today is not logically entailed.
7. The act of looking at a skateboard park does not inherently include the intention or action of skateboarding, making the hypothesis about skateboarding today speculative.
8. There is no causal relationship established in the premise between carrying a skateboard and using it immediately, which means the hypothesis remains unsubstantiated by the given information.
