1. Concerts typically charge a flat fee for entry, not per note, so charging per note is an unlikely scenario, making the statement implausible.
2. Concert attendees would not normally leave because charging per note is not a standard practice and would be an unexpected reason for departure.
3. The premise describes a concert setting, which usually means attendees have already paid for entry, making an additional charge per note improbable and contradictory.
4. Musicians and event organizers typically set pricing structures before a concert, not during, so deciding to charge per note mid-performance is unrealistic.
5. Charging per note during a concert would be logistically complex and unprecedented, which contradicts the typical experience of concert-goers.
6. Concerts are generally planned with pre-determined pricing, so a sudden decision to charge per note is contrary to standard practices in the music industry.
7. The notion of charging per note is not a feasible business model for concerts, and therefore it contradicts the usual expectations of concert-goers.
8. The premise implies a concert is ongoing, and a sudden change to charge per note would disrupt the event, which is not a typical occurrence.
9. Concert-goers expect to pay a set amount for admission; charging per note contradicts the usual financial transactions associated with concerts.
10. A concert is typically a structured event with fixed pricing, so deciding to charge per note would contradict the established norms of event management.
11. The concept of charging per note would likely be met with resistance or disbelief, as it contradicts the basic principles of how concerts operate.
