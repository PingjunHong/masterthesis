The side of the road refers to the location where the men are sitting.
The side of the road being empty contradicts the presence of men sitting there.
Men sitting implies the side of the road is occupied, not empty.
The term "side of the road" in the hypothesis is the same location mentioned in the premise, where men are present.
References to the side of the road in both premise and hypothesis indicate the same area, which cannot be empty due to the men's presence.
The premise identifies men on the side of the road, negating the hypothesis's claim of emptiness.
The side of the road containing men in the premise conflicts with the hypothesisâ€™s claim of it being empty.
