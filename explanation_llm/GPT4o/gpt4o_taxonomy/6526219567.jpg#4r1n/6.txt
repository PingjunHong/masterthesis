1. The premise does not mention any emotional reactions from people, so the hypothesis introduces a new aspect, creating a structural conflict.
2. The premise lacks any indication of offensiveness or controversy regarding the statue, while the hypothesis assumes such details.
3. The premise focuses on the observation that no one seems to be looking at the statue, which does not logically imply that people are offended or angry.
4. The hypothesis implies a strong emotional response (offense and anger), but the premise only describes a lack of attention, which does not necessarily correlate with the hypothesis.
5. The premise describes a neutral situation regarding the statue's observation, while the hypothesis suggests a negative perception, which is not supported by the premise.
6. The premise and hypothesis involve different logical structures: the premise describes a factual observation, while the hypothesis assumes an emotional and subjective interpretation.
7. The hypothesis suggests a response (anger) that is not logically necessitated by the premise, which merely notes a lack of attention.
8. The premise does not specify any reason for the absence of viewers, whereas the hypothesis attributes it to offensiveness, leading to a logical structure conflict.
9. The hypothesis implies an active reaction (being mad) that is not evident in the passive observation described in the premise.
10. The premise does not reference any controversy or discussion surrounding the statue, leading to a logical inconsistency with the hypothesis's claims of offensiveness.
