1. The premise does not provide any information about the emotional response or opinions of the people, so it cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis about the statue being offensive.
2. The word "offensive" in the hypothesis implies a specific emotional reaction that is not supported or contradicted by the premise.
3. The premise describes an observable action (no one seems to be looking at the statue) but does not include subjective interpretations like "offensive."
4. The hypothesis introduces the concept of people being "mad," which is not addressed in the premise, making it a separate aspect not tied to the observable scenario.
5. The term "offensive" in the hypothesis suggests a value judgment not present in the neutral description of the premise.
6. The premise lacks any mention of controversy or public sentiment, which are essential to substantiate the hypothesis.
