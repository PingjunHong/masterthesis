1. The sign 'HI-POINTE' suggests the building is not a hotel, as hotels typically have signs indicating their name or function, and 'HI-POINTE' does not convey this.
2. People standing outside a building implies they are not inside, contradicting the statement that they are sitting in the lobby.
3. The activity of standing and talking outside suggests casual interaction, whereas sitting in a hotel lobby implies a different setting and activity.
4. The premise describes an outdoor setting, which logically contradicts the indoor setting implied by being in a hotel lobby.
5. The sign 'HI-POINTE' does not align with typical hotel signage, suggesting the building is not a hotel and thus does not have a hotel lobby.
6. Real-world knowledge tells us that people standing outside are usually not simultaneously sitting inside, creating a causal contradiction.
7. The location described in the premise does not match typical features associated with hotel lobbies, such as interior seating and decor.
8. The presence of the sign 'HI-POINTE' implies a specific place or establishment that is not a hotel, contradicting the scenario of a hotel lobby.
9. The activity described in the premise indicates a social gathering outside, whereas sitting in a hotel lobby suggests a different scenario and purpose.
10. The word 'HI-POINTE' does not suggest a hotel name, and thus the statement about a hotel lobby contradicts the likely nature of the building.
