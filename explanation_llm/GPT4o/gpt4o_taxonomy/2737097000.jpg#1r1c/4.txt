1. If individuals are described as young adults, then they cannot be old adults, as 'young' and 'old' are mutually exclusive categories.
2. The term 'young adults' implies a certain age range typically associated with youth, which contradicts the description of 'old.'
3. The semantic meaning of 'young' directly opposes the semantic meaning of 'old,' leading to a contradiction.
4. The phrase 'young adults' logically excludes the possibility of being classified as 'old' based on the standard definitions of these age-related terms.
5. Describing individuals as 'young adults' inherently negates any implication that they might be 'old,' as the two terms describe distinct stages of life.
6. The word 'young' in 'young adults' suggests a relatively early stage of adulthood, which is logically incompatible with the idea of being 'old.'
7. The logical structure of the statement 'young adults' excludes the category of 'old,' making the hypothesis contradictory.
8. The modifier 'young' in 'young adults' sets an expectation of age that directly conflicts with the descriptor 'old' in the hypothesis.
