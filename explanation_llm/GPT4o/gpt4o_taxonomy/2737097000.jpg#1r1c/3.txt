1. The phrase "young adults" contradicts "the adults are old" because "young" and "old" are opposite descriptors for age.
2. "Young adults" implies individuals who are not old, which directly opposes the statement "the adults are old."
3. The term "young" in "young adults" structurally negates the possibility of the adults being "old" as stated.
4. Describing the individuals as "young adults" syntactically opposes describing them as "old" because "young" and "old" are mutually exclusive age categories.
5. The contradiction arises because "young" rephrases to mean "not old," whereas the hypothesis claims "the adults are old."
6. In the structure of the sentence, "young adults" is incompatible with the rephrased idea of "old adults."
7. The use of "young" in the premise inherently denies the possibility of the adults being described as "old" in the hypothesis.
8. The phrase "young adults" syntactically excludes the condition of being "old," thus directly contradicting the hypothesis.
9. The description "young adults" rephrased as "not old" is in direct structural opposition to "the adults are old."
