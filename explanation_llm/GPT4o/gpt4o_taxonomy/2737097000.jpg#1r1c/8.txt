1. Young adults are generally defined as individuals in their late teens to early thirties, which contradicts the statement that the adults are old.
2. The term "young adults" implies a certain age range that does not overlap with what is typically considered "old."
3. The description of "young adults" suggests they are likely in the early stages of adulthood, contrasting with the idea of being old.
4. In the context of age, young and old are distinct and mutually exclusive categories, making it a contradiction to label young adults as old.
5. Real-world understanding of age categories places young adults in a different demographic than old adults.
6. The concept of young adults inherently excludes characteristics associated with old age, such as advanced age-related physical decline.
7. Societal norms and definitions classify young adults as significantly younger than those considered old, creating a contradiction with the statement.
8. Probabilistically, young adults are far less likely to be considered old due to typical life expectancy and age progression.
9. The assumption that "young" and "old" describe different life stages results in a contradiction when applied to the same group.
