1. Being formally dressed does not affect the fact that the women are bald.
2. The age of the women does not affect the fact that they are bald.
3. The number of women mentioned is the same in both the premise and the hypothesis.
4. The premise specifies a formal dress code, which is irrelevant to confirming the baldness mentioned in the hypothesis.
5. The premise includes additional descriptors (formally dressed and older) that do not contradict the basic assertion of baldness.
6. The presence of hair is not implied by the formal attire or age, so baldness remains valid.
7. In the real world, being bald is independent of clothing style or age, supporting the entailment.
8. The hypothesis is a simplification that omits non-essential details, which does not negate the truth of the statement.
9. Common knowledge indicates that while age and attire can vary, baldness is a distinct characteristic that the premise confirms.
10. The premise provides more detail but does not introduce any conflicting information about the baldness.
11. The attire and age descriptors in the premise are additional but non-contradictory details to the baldness described in the hypothesis.
12. The hypothesis can logically and causally be derived by disregarding the extra details which do not affect the core information about baldness.
