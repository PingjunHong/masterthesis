1. The premise describes the women as older and formally dressed, but the hypothesis does not mention their age or attire, focusing only on their baldness.
2. The hypothesis does not specify the age or clothing style of the women, which are details present in the premise, making it non-contradictory but lacking complete information.
3. The description of the women as "older" and "formally dressed" is absent in the hypothesis, which only states the fact that they are bald, thus not contradicting the premise.
4. Although the premise specifies the women are formally dressed and older, the hypothesis does not include this information, merely confirming their baldness.
5. The hypothesis could apply to the premise since it omits details about the women's age and dress, focusing solely on their baldness, which is mentioned in both.
