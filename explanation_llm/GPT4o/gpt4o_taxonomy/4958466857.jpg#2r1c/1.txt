1. The statement "Two men own homes" implies that the men referenced have homes, whereas the premise refers to "Two homeless men," indicating they do not own homes.
2. The two men mentioned in the hypothesis are referred to as "homeless" in the premise, creating a contradiction when saying they own homes.
3. The phrase "Two men" in the statement is resolved to mean the same "two homeless men" described in the premise, leading to a contradiction because homeless men do not own homes.
4. The coreference between "Two men" in the statement and "Two homeless men" in the premise leads to a contradiction since owning homes contradicts being homeless.
5. The reference to "men" in both the premise and statement points to the same individuals, but their described statuses (homeless vs. homeowners) are contradictory.
6. Resolving "Two men" in the statement to "Two homeless men" in the premise reveals a contradiction, as the premise explicitly states the men are homeless, yet the statement claims they own homes.
7. The hypothesis contradicts the premise because the "Two men" it refers to are established as homeless in the premise, directly opposing the idea of them owning homes.
