1. The presence of a pile of coconuts on the ground implies that the person is near them due to their involvement in working with a steel apparatus, likely related to the coconuts.
2. Being outside where the coconuts are located suggests physical proximity, satisfying the condition of being near the pile of coconuts.
3. The action of working a steel apparatus near the coconuts indicates that the person is in close proximity to the coconuts, as the apparatus is likely used for processing them.
4. The setup described, with the person standing outside and the coconuts on the ground, logically places the person near the coconuts within the environment.
5. The scenario of working on a steel apparatus with coconuts present suggests the coconuts are directly involved in the activity, requiring the person to be near them.
6. A straw hat is often worn for outdoor activities, and with coconuts on the ground, it is reasonable to deduce that the person is working close to them.
7. Real-world knowledge of coconut handling or processing often involves immediate access to the coconuts, reinforcing the personâ€™s proximity to the pile.
8. The spatial relationship typically necessary for working with an apparatus and a specific material (coconuts) suggests the person must be near the pile.
9. Assumed knowledge about outdoor work involving coconuts implies that the person wouldn't be far from the coconuts they are working with.
10. The logical necessity of being near the materials one is working with (coconuts, in this case) supports the entailment of the person being near the coconuts.
