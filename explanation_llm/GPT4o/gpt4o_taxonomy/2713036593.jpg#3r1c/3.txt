1. Sitting and lying down describe different positions, thus a man sitting cannot simultaneously be lying down.
2. The structure "sitting on the floor" cannot be rephrased as "lying down" without altering the position described.
3. Sitting implies an upright or bent posture, whereas lying down implies a horizontal posture, leading to a contradiction in position.
4. The phrase "sitting on the floor" structurally contrasts with "lying down," indicating different physical postures.
5. "Sitting" and "lying down" are syntactically distinct terms that describe mutually exclusive positions.
6. The structural rephrasing from "sitting" to "lying down" changes the physical state described, resulting in contradiction.
7. The syntactic alteration from "sitting" to "lying down" transforms the action, thereby contradicting the original description.
