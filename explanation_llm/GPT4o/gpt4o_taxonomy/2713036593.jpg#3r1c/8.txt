1. Sitting on the floor and lying down are distinct positions; a person cannot be sitting and lying down simultaneously.
2. Real-world understanding of posture indicates that sitting and lying down involve different body alignments.
3. The act of sitting generally involves an upright position, whereas lying down implies a horizontal position.
4. Probabilistic reasoning suggests that if a person is sitting, they are unlikely to be lying down at the same time.
5. Assumed knowledge about human body positions indicates that sitting does not equate to lying down.
6. The spatial orientation of the body when sitting differs from that when lying down, making the two mutually exclusive.
7. The description of someone sitting implies they are not in a position consistent with lying down, based on common understanding.
8. A man cannot occupy two contradictory positions (sitting and lying down) at the same moment.
9. Real-world experience informs us that sitting and lying down are contradictory postures.
10. The physical arrangement when sitting prevents simultaneous lying down, as per basic human anatomy.
