1. The premise does not mention a baseball game, so there is no evidence to support that the choir is singing at one.
2. The choir is described as singing at a church, which does not provide information about any other locations, such as a baseball game.
3. There is no indication in the premise that the choir performs outside of the church setting.
4. The premise specifies that the choir sings songs from a book at a church, with no mention of any other venue or event.
5. Singing to the masses at a church does not imply or entail singing at a baseball game.
6. The setting of a baseball game is not addressed in the premise, leaving the location of the choir's performance unsupported.
7. The premise focuses solely on a church environment, lacking any mention of a sports event or venue like a baseball game.
8. The context provided does not extend beyond a church, so the hypothesis introduces an unsupported scenario.
