- The premise states the choir sings songs from the book at a church, indicating the setting is religious, not a sports event like a baseball game.
- The concept of "singing to the masses at a church" suggests a religious gathering, contradicting the notion of a performance at a baseball game.
- "Singing joyous songs from the book" implies the songs are religious hymns, which are not typically performed at baseball games.
- The premise describes the choir's activity as part of a church service, creating a contradiction with the hypothesis that suggests a secular event.
- The act of singing "joyous songs from the book" at a church is inherently different from the environment and context of a baseball game.
