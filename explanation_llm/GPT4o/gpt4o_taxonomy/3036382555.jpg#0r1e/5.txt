1. The premise does not specify the activities the girls are engaged in, only that they are playing, so the hypothesis cannot be fully supported.
2. The premise mentions the girls are dressed as fairies and playing in leaves, but does not explicitly state that they are playing generally outdoors, so the hypothesis is not directly confirmed by the premise.
3. The premise describes the setting outdoors but doesn't specifically state the broader activity of playing outdoors, leading to a lack of explicit evidence for the hypothesis.
4. While the premise includes outdoor activities, it focuses on playing in leaves, leaving the broader concept of playing outdoors unmentioned.
5. The premise's emphasis on the fairy costumes and leaf play does not explicitly affirm the more general activity of playing outdoors.
6. The hypothesis simplifies the premise's details by omitting specifics like the fairy costumes and leaves, leading to a lack of direct mention in the premise.
7. The absence of explicit mention of "playing outdoors" as an activity distinct from "playing in leaves" in the premise means the hypothesis lacks direct support.
8. The hypothesis generalizes the outdoor setting without specific reference to the detailed context of playing in leaves, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.
