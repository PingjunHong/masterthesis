1. "She" in the premise refers to the woman doing gymnastics, not a woman napping.
2. The woman referred to as "she" is actively using the balance beam, contradicting the idea of her napping.
3. The activity of using the balance beam implies alertness and activity, directly opposing the inactivity of napping.
4. The premise describes a woman engaged in gymnastics, clearly identifying "she" as someone not at rest, which contradicts the hypothesis.
5. The coreference of "she" to the woman involved in gymnastics indicates she cannot simultaneously be napping.
6. "A woman doing gymnastics" aligns with "she is using the balance beam," contradicting the state of being asleep.
7. The premise establishes the woman's action as gymnastics, conflicting with the hypothesis where "she" would be napping.
8. The premise's "she" actively engaged on the balance beam makes it impossible for her to be napping simultaneously.
