1. If a woman is doing gymnastics, she cannot simultaneously be napping because performing gymnastics requires active participation.
2. Using the balance beam implies that the woman is awake and physically active, which contradicts the state of napping.
3. The act of napping involves inactivity and rest, which is incompatible with the dynamic and focused activity of using a balance beam.
4. Gymnastics on a balance beam necessitates alertness and concentration, conditions that do not align with the unconscious state of napping.
5. The presence of a woman actively engaged in gymnastics logically excludes the possibility of her being asleep at the same time.
6. Being on a balance beam suggests physical exertion and balance, which contradicts the passive state required for napping.
7. The description of performing gymnastics involves movement and coordination, contradictory to the stillness and lack of movement inherent in napping.
