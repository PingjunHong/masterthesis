1. If someone is pushing a cart, they are using their hands for pushing, not for holding or reading a paper.
2. The action of pushing a cart requires physical engagement that is not compatible with the action of reading a paper simultaneously.
3. A person cannot be actively involved in pushing a cart and reading a newspaper at the same time, as both activities require focus and attention.
4. The premise describes a person engaged in a specific physical activity (pushing a cart), which contradicts the hypothesis of them being engaged in a different, incompatible activity (reading the paper).
5. The description of pushing a cart implies movement and physical effort, whereas reading a paper typically involves stationary behavior, creating a contradiction.
6. The premise's activity of pushing a cart suggests the person is outdoors and mobile, while reading a paper usually implies a more sedentary and stationary position.
7. The verb "pushing" indicates an active motion, which is logically contradictory to the typically passive act of reading.
8. The simultaneous performance of pushing a cart and reading a newspaper would require more hands or attention than a single person can logically provide.
