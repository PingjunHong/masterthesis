1. Cutting wood can involve various purposes, and the statement adds a purpose not mentioned in the content, which changes the meaning.
2. The content describes sawing a log in half, whereas the statement implies cutting wood with a specific intention to build a table, which alters the context.
3. Sawing a log in half does not inherently imply the purpose of building a table, making the statement neutral.
4. The structure of "cutting wood to build a table" introduces a causal link not present in the original description of "sawing a log in half."
5. The premise describes an action without specifying a reason, while the hypothesis introduces a specific intention, leading to a neutral relationship.
6. The statement includes a goal ("to build a table") that is syntactically subordinated to the action of cutting wood, differing from the premise which lacks such subordination.
7. The hypothesis includes coordination of actions and intentions that are not present in the straightforward description of the premise.
8. The syntactic structure of the hypothesis introduces an assumption about the purpose of the action that is not evident from the premise alone.
