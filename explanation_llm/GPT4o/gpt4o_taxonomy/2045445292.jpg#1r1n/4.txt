1. The statement suggests the purpose of cutting wood is to build a table, but the premise only indicates the action of sawing a log in half, without specifying the intended use for the wood.
2. The premise describes an activity involving cutting a log, which could be for various reasons, not necessarily for furniture construction as implied by the statement.
3. While the statement indicates a specific outcome of building a table, the premise merely describes the act of sawing a log, leaving the future use of the wood ambiguous.
4. The premise focuses on the immediate action of sawing without providing information about subsequent steps, such as using the wood for building a table as stated.
5. The statement introduces a potential purpose (table-building) not directly supported by the premise, which only details the current task of sawing.
6. The activity described in the premise is sawing a log, which does not logically imply the specific purpose of constructing a table mentioned in the statement.
7. The premise outlines the action of cutting a log, not the intention behind it, allowing for multiple possibilities, including but not limited to table construction.
8. Sawing a log in the premise is an incomplete task description that does not specify building a table, leaving the purpose described in the statement open to interpretation.
9. The statement presumes a particular outcome from the activity described in the premise, which is not explicitly indicated or implied by the text itself.
10. The premise lacks any mention of a table or construction, making the statement about table-building a neutral assumption rather than a direct implication.
