1. The statement "six people get ready to eat a seventh who is injured" is a syntactic rephrasing that implies cannibalism, which is contradictory to the premise about rescuers aiding an injured man.
2. The premise describes a cooperative rescue effort, while the statement suggests a hostile and predatory action, representing a structural rephrasing with opposite meanings.
3. "Six rescuers cooperate" is structurally opposed to "six people get ready to eat," as the former implies assistance, while the latter implies harm.
4. The concept of "placing an injured man on a transport device" is syntactically different from "getting ready to eat a seventh," as one implies help and the other harm.
5. The phrase "in snowy, mountainous terrain" suggests a rescue operation environment, which is structurally at odds with the statement's implied scenario of preparing for cannibalism.
6. The premise's focus on cooperation for rescue syntactically conflicts with the statement's focus on preparing to eat, which involves harm, not help.
7. The structural implication of teamwork in the premise is a direct contradiction to the predatory structural implication in the statement.
