1. The premise describes a couple eating outside at a table, which logically implies that there are people eating at a table outside. Couples consist of at least two people, fulfilling the requirement for "people" in the hypothesis.
2. Real-world knowledge indicates that a couple refers to two people, and if they are eating outside at a table, it means that people are eating at a table outside, confirming the hypothesis.
3. When a couple is eating outside at a table, it is understood that they are engaged in the act of eating, thus supporting the hypothesis that people are eating at a table outside.
4. The premise includes a couple eating outside, which causally leads to the conclusion that there are people eating outside at a table, as "couple" inherently refers to two individuals.
5. Probabilistic reasoning suggests that when a couple is described as eating outside at a table, the likelihood that people are eating at a table outside is high, making the hypothesis an entailment.
6. The action of the couple eating outside naturally includes the presence of people, aligning with the hypothesis that there are people eating at a table outside.
7. Assumed information about the definition of "couple" implies multiple people, thereby fulfilling the hypothesis that people are eating at a table outside.
8. Causal reasoning links the couple eating at the table with the hypothesis, as the act of eating inherently involves people at the table outside.
9. The use of the term "couple" in the premise logically infers multiple people, which satisfies the hypothesis that people are eating at an outside table.
10. The context of the couple eating outside suggests the presence of people, as eating is a communal activity, thereby entailing the hypothesis.
