1. The premise describes a woman walking towards a flock of birds, but it does not explicitly mention the presence of birds near her, leaving the hypothesis unsupported by evidence.
2. The hypothesis suggests that birds are near the woman, yet the premise only indicates she is walking towards birds, not that they are near her, leaving the claim unverified.
3. The premise lacks information about the proximity of birds to the woman; it mentions her walking towards them, but does not confirm their nearness as stated in the hypothesis.
4. The woman is described as walking towards a flock of birds, which implies movement, but it does not confirm the birds are currently near her, making the hypothesis unsupported.
5. The absence of explicit mention of the birds being near the woman in the premise leaves open the possibility that she is approaching them from a distance, contradicting the implied proximity in the hypothesis.
6. While the woman is walking towards the birds, the premise does not specify their location relative to her, and thus does not support the claim that the birds are near her.
7. The premise illustrates a movement towards birds without confirming their location in relation to the woman, meaning the hypothesis lacks direct evidence.
8. The statement in the hypothesis assumes birds are near the woman, but the premise only indicates she is walking towards them, with no confirmation of proximity or location.
9. The premise provides no information on the spatial relationship between the woman and the birds, failing to support the hypothesis's assertion of their nearness.
10. The hypothesis implies a static position of birds near the woman, whereas the premise only indicates her motion towards them, leaving the claim unsupported by direct mention or evidence.
