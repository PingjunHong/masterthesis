1. The premise describes a skateboarder in the context of a jump on a snowy day, while the hypothesis introduces jogging down the street, which is not mentioned in the premise.
2. The premise involves a skateboarder performing a jump, but does not provide any information about jogging, making the hypothesis unsupported.
3. The premise does not contain any mention of streets or jogging, suggesting the hypothesis introduces details not found in the premise.

5. The setting in the premise is snowy, whereas the hypothesis mentions a street, an environment absent from the premise.
6. The premise focuses on a skateboarder's jump, while the hypothesis shifts to jogging, which is not mentioned, leading to a lack of supporting evidence.
7. The premise does not specify any movement like jogging, so the hypothesis introduces new information not entailed by the premise.
