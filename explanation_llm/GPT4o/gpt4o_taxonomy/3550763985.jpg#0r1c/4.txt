1. Being at the top of a jump implies being airborne or elevated, which contradicts jogging, as jogging requires being on the ground.

3. A skateboarder at the top of a jump implies engagement in skateboarding activity, which contradicts the activity of jogging.
4. A skateboarder wearing a hat at the top of a jump is engaged in skateboarding, not an activity like jogging that typically involves different attire or equipment.
5. The presence of snow implies a setting where jogging might be impractical or unsafe, contradicting the scenario of jogging down the street.
