1. Preparing a fish does not necessarily mean cleaning it, as preparation can include various tasks such as gutting, scaling, or filleting, none of which are explicitly mentioned.
2. The premise does not specify that the fish belongs to the men, so the ownership of the fish cannot be inferred.
3. The premise lacks mention of any cleaning activity; preparing a fish can involve other actions, such as seasoning or cooking.
4. The description of the activity at the dock does not include cleaning tools or materials, so we cannot conclude cleaning is taking place.
5. The premise does not provide details on the state of the fish, such as whether it requires cleaning, leaving the hypothesis unsupported.
