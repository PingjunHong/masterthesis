1. The premise mentions a parade or festival, but it does not specify which parade, so the statement about St Patrick's Day is not directly supported.
2. The premise describes cleaners at a parade or festival in general terms, without naming a specific event, making the specific mention of St Patrick's Day in the statement unverifiable.
3. The premise involves a situation that could occur at various events, including but not limited to St Patrick's Day, making the exact event in the statement not logically necessitated by the premise.
4. There is no explicit mention of St Patrick's Day in the premise, so the connection to that specific event in the statement is not logically derived from the information given.
5. The premise allows for multiple interpretations regarding the type of event, and St Patrick's Day is just one of many possibilities, making the statement neither confirmed nor denied.
6. The statement introduces a specific event that is not explicitly identified in the premise, resulting in a lack of direct logical implication from the premise to the statement.
7. The premise provides a general scenario that could fit any parade or festival context, so the statementâ€™s specific association with St Patrick's Day is not a direct logical outcome of the premise.
8. The premise does not contain any information that uniquely ties the cleaning activity to St Patrick's Day, leaving the statement as a plausible but unsubstantiated possibility.
