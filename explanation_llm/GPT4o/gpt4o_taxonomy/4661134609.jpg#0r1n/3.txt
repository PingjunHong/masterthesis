1. Workers cleaning up after St Patrick's Day could refer to a different event or festival, not necessarily the parade or festival mentioned in the premise.
2. The act of sweeping animal feces does not explicitly indicate that the event is St Patrick's Day, as similar activities could occur at various parades or festivals.
3. The term "cleaners" in the premise does not specifically equate to "workers" associated with St Patrick's Day in the hypothesis.
4. The description of sweeping animal feces is not structurally equivalent to specifying the event as St Patrick's Day.
5. The premise describes an action during a parade or festival, whereas the hypothesis specifies a particular event which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
6. The premise's focus on the activity of cleaning does not syntactically match the event-specific detail in the hypothesis.
7. The premise gives a general scenario of a parade or festival which does not syntactically rephrase the specific mention of St Patrick's Day in the hypothesis.
8. Both statements refer to cleaning activities related to an event, but the hypothesis does not structurally rephrase the premise to confirm it's the same event.
