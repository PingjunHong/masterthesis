- "Standing in a boat" is syntactically different from "standing on top of a car," indicating the actions occur in different locations and cannot be rephrased to mean the same thing.
- The structure of "standing in a boat" cannot be altered to mean "standing on top of a car" as the objects involved (boat vs. car) are fundamentally different.
- The verb phrase "standing in" cannot be restructured to imply "standing on top of" without changing the intended meaning and location.
- "In a boat" structurally contradicts "on top of a car" because the prepositions "in" and "on top of" indicate different spatial relations that cannot be rephrased to align with each other.
- The coordination of "men are standing in a boat" does not syntactically alternate to "men are standing on top of a car" due to the distinct objects involved (boat vs. car).
- "Standing in a boat" utilizes subordination in a context incompatible with "standing on top of a car," as the spatial prepositions used denote different positions and environments.
- The structural elements of "a boat" and "a car" cannot be rephrased to have the same meaning, leading to a contradiction in the locations described.
