1. The premise does not specify the location of the boys, so they could be walking in a driveway, parking lot, or any area where the car is parked, not necessarily on the street.
2. The statement assumes the boys are on the street, but there is no mention in the premise about the boys' exact location relative to the street.
3. The premise mentions the boys walking behind a car, but it does not confirm whether this is happening on a street or any other specific location.
4. The boys could be on a path, sidewalk, or any surface near the car that is not explicitly a street, as the premise does not provide this detail.
5. The hypothesis introduces the idea of the boys being on the street, which is not supported by the information given in the premise.
6. The presence of the older model Ford car could imply various settings like a garage or private property, not just a street, which is not clarified in the premise.
7. The premise focuses on the boys' action and their clothing, without mentioning any specific details about their surroundings being a street.
8. The absence of the word "street" in the premise means we cannot conclusively determine the boys' location as being on a street.
