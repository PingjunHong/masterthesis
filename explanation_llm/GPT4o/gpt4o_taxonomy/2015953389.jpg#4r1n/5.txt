- The premise mentions workers standing on a lift, but does not provide any information about them walking off the lift.
- There is no evidence in the premise to support the notion that workers have walked off the lift.
- The premise describes a scenario where workers are on the lift, but it does not mention any movement or action of walking off, hence the hypothesis is not supported.
- The premise implies a stationary position on the lift for the workers, absent any mention of them leaving it.
- The hypothesis introduces the action of walking off, which is not mentioned or implied by the premise.
- The absence of any details in the premise about workers walking off the lift leads to a contradiction with the hypothesis.
- The premise lacks any reference to the workers exiting or disembarking from the lift, countering the hypothesis.
- The hypothesis suggests a change in the location of the workers, which is not alluded to in the premise.
- The premise does not contain any information that would corroborate the action of walking off described in the hypothesis.
- Without mention of movement or departure, the premise cannot substantiate the hypothesis about workers walking off the lift.
