1. It is impossible for workers to be standing on a lift and walking off it simultaneously.
2. Standing and walking are mutually exclusive actions that cannot occur at the same moment.
3. If workers are standing on a lift, they cannot be in the process of walking off the lift.
4. The act of standing on a lift contradicts the act of walking off it because both actions cannot be performed at the same time.
5. Workers cannot occupy two distinct positions on and off the lift concurrently.
6. For workers to walk off a lift, they must first cease standing on it, creating a contradiction.
7. The physical state of standing on a lift negates the possibility of currently walking off it.
8. If workers are still on the lift, they haven't yet completed the action of walking off it.
9. Being on the lift implies a stationary position, conflicting with the motion implied by walking off.
10. The statement that workers walk off a lift assumes a change in location that being on the lift doesnâ€™t allow.
