1. "Some people stand around" implies that at least one person is standing, but the premise mentions three people sitting on a bench, indicating that no one is standing.
2. The reference to "people" in the hypothesis is resolved to the "three people" in the premise, all of whom are described as sitting, contradicting the notion of standing.
3. The man mentioned in the premise is sitting on the bench, not standing, which contradicts the statement about people standing around.
4. The two women in the premise are described as sitting, resolving the reference in the hypothesis to standing people, which contradicts the premise's description.
5. The reference to "some people" in the hypothesis is resolved to the man and the two women in the premise, all of whom are sitting, contradicting the idea of standing.
6. The reference to "people" in the hypothesis contradicts the description of "three people sit on a bench" in the premise, as sitting and standing are mutually exclusive.
7. "Stand" in the hypothesis refers back to the position of the three individuals in the premise, who are described as sitting, thus creating a contradiction.
8. The hypothesis suggests a standing position which is resolved to the sitting position of the man, the redheaded woman, and the yellow blond girl in the premise, leading to a contradiction.
9. The phrase "stand around" implies a different action than "sit on a bench," and resolving the reference from hypothesis to premise shows the contradiction between standing and sitting.
10. The hypothesis implies a different spatial arrangement than the one described in the premise, where all referenced individuals are seated.
