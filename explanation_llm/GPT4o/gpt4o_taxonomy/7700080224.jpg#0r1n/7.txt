1. The number of players in a volleyball team can vary, so the exact number of players isn't specified.
2. A volleyball team typically consists of six players, but substitutions and different formats can alter the count.
3. The premise doesn't specify the number of players on each team, so it's not guaranteed there are exactly 12 players.
4. The term "ladies" may not accurately describe all participants without explicit clarification.
5. The statement makes an assumption about the number of players without evidence from the premise.
6. Volleyball matches can involve varying team sizes, so the total number of players isn't inherently 12.
