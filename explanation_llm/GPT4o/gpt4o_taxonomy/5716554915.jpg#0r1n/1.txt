- "Her studio" in the statement does not necessarily refer to the location described in the content, as the content does not explicitly identify the setting as a studio.
- The pronoun "her" in "her studio" could refer to any woman, not necessarily the woman lying on the yoga mat, as the content does not establish ownership of the studio.
