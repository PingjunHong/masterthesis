1. Brick roads are a type of road, so if men are sitting on the side of a brick road, it logically follows that they are sitting on the side of a road.
2. The concept of a brick road encompasses the broader category of roads, making it reasonable to conclude that sitting on the side of a brick road implies sitting on the side of a road.
3. In common understanding, a brick road is simply a specific form of road, so mentioning a brick road inherently includes the fact that it is a road.
4. The material composition of the road (brick) is additional detail, but does not change the fundamental classification of the path as a road.
5. Real-world knowledge about roads tells us that a brick road serves the same function as any other road, allowing us to infer that a brick road is still a road.
6. The term "brick road" specifies the type of road, but in doing so, it confirms the presence of a road, fulfilling the condition of men sitting on the side of a road.
7. In practical terms, if someone is sitting on the side of any type of road, including a brick road, they are unmistakably sitting on the side of a road.
8. The distinction between types of roads is unnecessary for the hypothesis, as all types of roads, including brick ones, satisfy the condition of being roads.
