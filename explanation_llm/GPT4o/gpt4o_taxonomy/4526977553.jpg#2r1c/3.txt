1. The premise describes a woman who is actively walking, while the statement describes a woman who is sitting, indicating opposite actions.
2. The premise specifies the woman is wearing jeans, while the statement describes an elderly woman with a cane, suggesting differences in age and attire.
3. Walking down the street implies movement, contradicting sitting on a chair, which implies stillness.
4. The presence of a cane in the statement suggests the woman might need assistance walking, contradicting the premise of a woman walking unaided.
5. The premise involves a singular action of walking, while the statement involves the singular action of sitting, which are mutually exclusive.

8. The structural roles of the two women are differentâ€”one is an active participant in movement, while the other is in a passive state of rest, indicating a contradiction.
9. The use of the term "elderly" in the statement contrasts with the unspecified age in the premise, which does not imply elderliness or the need for a cane.
