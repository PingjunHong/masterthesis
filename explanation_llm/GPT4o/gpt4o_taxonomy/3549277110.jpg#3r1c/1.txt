- "Two boys" in the premise refers to the same "two boys" in the hypothesis; however, their actions differ as reading and watching are distinct activities.
- The premise mentions "reading superhero books," which involves books, whereas the hypothesis states "watching a superhero show," indicating a show, not books.
- The reference to "superhero books" in the premise conflicts with "superhero show" in the hypothesis, as books and shows are different mediums.
- "Reading" from the premise and "watching" from the hypothesis are actions that cannot occur simultaneously in this context, leading to a contradiction.
- The noun "books" in the premise refers to physical objects that are read, while the noun "show" in the hypothesis refers to a visual performance, resulting in a contradiction.
