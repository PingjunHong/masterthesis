3. The premise describes an activity that could occur outside but does not explicitly confirm the setting, leaving room for alternative interpretations.
4. The premise does not provide direct evidence or mention of the environment being outside, so the hypothesis assumes without direct support.

6. The hypothesis includes the assumption of an outdoor setting, which is not directly stated or confirmed in the premise.
