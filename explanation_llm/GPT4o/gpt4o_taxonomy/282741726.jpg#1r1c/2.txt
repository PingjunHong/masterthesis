1. The word "writing" implies an activity different from "sharing a meal," which involves eating rather than writing.
2. "Watching" indicates an action that is not typically associated with "sharing a meal," as participating in a meal involves eating rather than watching.
3. "Facing the same direction" does not imply "sharing a meal," as meals typically involve people facing each other for conversation and interaction.
4. "Seated at long tables" does not inherently mean "sharing a meal," as tables can be used for various activities such as writing or watching, not exclusively eating.
5. "People seated" does not specify that they are "sharing a meal," as seating can occur in multiple contexts unrelated to dining.
6. The absence of any mention of food or eating in the premise contradicts the idea of "sharing a meal" in the statement.
7. "Some writing and some watching" suggests activities that are incompatible with "sharing a meal," as meals generally involve consistent participation in eating.
