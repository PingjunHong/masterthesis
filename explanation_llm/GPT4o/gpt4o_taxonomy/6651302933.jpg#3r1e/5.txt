4. It is assumed that kite surfing is an outdoor activity, but the premise does not confirm this assumption.
5. The term "outdoors" is not directly referenced in the premise, leaving room for interpretation about the activity's location.
6. The premise does not provide explicit evidence of the activity being outdoors, even though it is a reasonable assumption.
7. The environment where the kite surfing takes place is not described, so the hypothesis introduces an assumption not directly supported by the premise.
8. While kite surfing generally requires outdoor conditions, the premise does not make this explicit, and the hypothesis assumes it without direct mention.
9. The premise lacks specific details about the location, making the hypothesis plausible but not explicitly confirmed.
