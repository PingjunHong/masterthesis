1. The premise does not mention anyone juggling baseballs, so there is no supporting evidence for the hypothesis.
2. The premise describes fans relaxing and enjoying the game, which contradicts the hypothesis where fans are described as upset.
3. The hypothesis introduces the idea of juggling baseballs, which is not supported by any information in the premise.
4. The premise focuses on a baseball game scenario with a pitcher and fans, not on juggling activities.
5. There is no mention of a man juggling in the premise, so the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it.
6. The hypothesis suggests an emotional state (fans being upset) that is not mentioned in the premise.
7. The activity described in the hypothesis (juggling) is unrelated to the baseball context provided in the premise.
8. The premise does not provide any information about the fans' emotional reactions that would support the hypothesis.
9. There is no evidence in the premise to suggest that the fans are observing anything other than the baseball game.
10. The hypothesis introduces new actions (juggling) and emotions (upset) that are absent in the premise, leading to a contradiction.
