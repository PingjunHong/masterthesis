1. The premise does not specify the direction of the escalator, so the people could be going either up or down.
2. There is no indication from the premise that the escalator is designed only to move upwards.
3. The act of looking outside the glass does not suggest any particular direction of travel on the escalator.
4. The destination of the people is unknown; it could be on a higher or lower floor, leaving the direction ambiguous.
5. Observing the view through the glass while on an escalator does not provide evidence about the escalator's movement direction.
6. Real-world escalators can move in either direction, and the premise does not clarify which applies here.
7. The statement about people waiting to get to their destination does not inherently involve an upward movement.
8. Without additional context, the assumption of the escalator moving upward is speculative.
9. The structural design of buildings can involve escalators moving in various directions to reach different destinations.
10. The premise lacks details about any specific floor or level change that would necessitate upward movement.
