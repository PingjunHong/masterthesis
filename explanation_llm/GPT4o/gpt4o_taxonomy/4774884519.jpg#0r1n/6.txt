1. The escalator could be moving up or down, and the premise does not specify the direction.
2. "Waiting to get to their destination" does not imply a specific direction of movement.
3. The glass wall view does not provide information about the escalator's direction.
4. The premise does not include any directional cues, such as "ascending" or "descending."
5. The statement "going up" introduces a direction not specified in the premise.
6. The premise and statement do not have a temporal reference to indicate when the escalator is moving in a particular direction.
7. The statement assumes an upward movement, but the premise allows for either direction.
8. The people could be stationary on the escalator regardless of its direction.
9. The location (escalator) itself allows for movement in either direction, contradicting the exclusivity of "going up."
10. The use of "waiting" implies a pause in movement, which conflicts with the assumption of continuous upward movement.
