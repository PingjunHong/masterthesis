1. The statement "The people are going up on the escalator" is not a structural rephrasing of "People are on an escalator waiting to get to their destination while looking outside of the glass that makes up the wall."
2. The statement introduces a direction (going up) that is not explicitly stated in the content, which does not involve syntactic rephrasing.
3. The content focuses on people being on an escalator and looking outside, whereas the statement emphasizes an upward movement, not captured in the content.
4. The content describes people waiting on an escalator, and the statement implies movement in a specific direction, which is beyond structural rephrasing.
5. The content and statement differ in focus: one on the action of waiting and looking, the other on the action of going up, thus not a syntactic alternation.
