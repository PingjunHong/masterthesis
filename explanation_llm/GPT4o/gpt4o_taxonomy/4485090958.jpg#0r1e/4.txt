1. The phrase "a large building with people loitering or waiting on the steps" implies that there are people present outside the building.
2. "People are loitering or waiting on the steps of said building" indicates that there are multiple individuals outside the building.
3. The term "people" in the premise is plural, meaning more than one person, which satisfies the "several people" in the hypothesis.
4. The description of the building as having steps where people are present suggests that these individuals are located outside the building.
5. The mention of "a large building" combined with "people on the steps" inherently situates these people outside of the building.
6. "Loitering or waiting on the steps" implies the presence of people outside since steps are part of the external structure of a building.
7. The premise describes people in relation to a building, thereby logically placing them outside, consistent with the hypothesis.
8. The structure "a large building with people" supports the interpretation that these people are outside, as they are associated with the steps, which are typically external.
