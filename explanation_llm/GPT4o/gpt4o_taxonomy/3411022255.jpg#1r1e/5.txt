1. The premise specifies "four people," but the hypothesis does not mention the number of people, which could imply a different number of people crossing the street.
2. The premise includes the detail "at a crosswalk," which is absent in the hypothesis, potentially suggesting they are crossing elsewhere.
3. The premise mentions "four people and a baby," but the hypothesis could be interpreted as not specifying the relationship between the people and the baby, such as a family or strangers.
4. The premise states "crossing the street," while the hypothesis lacks specifics about the location or method of crossing, such as whether they are using a crosswalk or jaywalking.
5. The premise describes the action as "crossing," while the hypothesis does not specify whether they are actively crossing, have already crossed, or are about to cross.
6. The premise includes "four people and a baby," potentially suggesting six individuals, whereas the hypothesis could imply fewer or more individuals if interpreted differently.
7. The hypothesis does not mention any details about the appearance, behavior, or interaction of the people and the baby, which are unspecified in the premise and could affect interpretation.
8. The premise specifies "a baby," while the hypothesis could imply multiple babies or not specify the presence of a baby at all.
9. The absence of detail in the hypothesis regarding the context or environment, such as traffic conditions or weather, which are unspecified in the premise, could lead to different interpretations.
10. The hypothesis does not mention whether the crossing is happening in a specific city or country, which could differ from what is implied in the premise.
