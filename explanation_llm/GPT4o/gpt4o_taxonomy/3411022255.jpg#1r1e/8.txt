1. A crosswalk is a designated area for pedestrians to cross the street, so it is reasonable to infer that people and a baby crossing the street are using the crosswalk.
2. The term "people" can refer to any number of individuals, and since "four people" includes "people," the statement is a general description of the premise.
3. In common language, "a baby" crossing the street with "people" suggests the same scenario as "four people and a baby" crossing together, aligning both the premise and the statement.
4. When people cross a street, they typically use a crosswalk for safety, so the action of crossing the street is inherently linked to the use of a crosswalk.
5. The presence of a baby among the group of people crossing the street does not alter the fundamental activity described, which is people and a baby crossing the street.
6. A group consisting of four people and a baby naturally includes both "people" and "a baby," which matches the statement's description.
7. It is common knowledge that streets have designated areas for pedestrians, and crossing at these points is a typical behavior, thus supporting the statement as a more general observation of the premise.
8. The activity of crossing the street implies that all individuals mentioned, including the baby, are engaged in the same action, which is captured by the statement.
9. The scenario of a group, including a baby, crossing a street is inherently covered by the broader phrase "people and a baby crossing the street."
10. In real-world settings, a crosswalk is intended for pedestrian use, so the mentioned group of four people and a baby would be expected to cross at such a location, aligning with the statement.
