1. A crosswalk is a designated area for pedestrians to cross the street, so it is logical for people and a baby to be crossing there.
2. The term "people" can include any number greater than one, encompassing the four individuals mentioned in the premise.
3. Babies are included in the category of people; therefore, the baby mentioned is part of the group crossing the street.
4. The action of crossing the street is consistent with the scenario described for both the people and the baby.
5. People and babies are commonly found together in public spaces such as crosswalks.
6. The premise explicitly states that four people and a baby are crossing the street, which aligns with the idea that people and a baby are crossing the street.
7. A baby is typically accompanied by adults when crossing the street, supporting the premise description.
8. Street crossing involves movement from one side to another, which is implied in both the premise and the hypothesis.
9. In urban settings, it is common to see groups of people, including babies, using crosswalks to safely cross the street.
10. The presence of a baby does not contradict the notion of people crossing the street; rather, it complements the scene described.
