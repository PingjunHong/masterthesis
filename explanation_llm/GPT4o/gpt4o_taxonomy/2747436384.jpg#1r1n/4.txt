1. If an approaching wave is about to hit four boys, then a giant wave is about to crash on them.
2. The phrase "about to be hit" implies an imminent event, which aligns with "about to crash."
3. The term "approaching wave" semantically suggests a large or significant wave, which aligns with the description of a "giant wave."
4. The word "some" in "some boys" is logically inclusive of "four boys."
5. The structure of the premise implies a direct interaction between the boys and the wave, supporting the hypothesis of a crash.
6. The use of "approaching" in the premise logically suggests that the wave is close enough to crash imminently, matching the hypothesis.
7. The presence of a wave and boys in both premise and hypothesis connect directly in their semantic roles, leading to the same outcome described as a crash.
8. The premise's scenario naturally leads to the conclusion that the wave will impact the boys, which is captured by "crash on" in the hypothesis.
9. The logical progression from "about to be hit" to "about to crash" is consistent in both statements.
10. The semantics of "wave" in both statements imply a similar size and force, reinforcing the entailment.
