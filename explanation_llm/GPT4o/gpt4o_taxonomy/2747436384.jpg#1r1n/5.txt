1. The premise describes an approaching wave but does not specify the size of the wave, so it is not mentioned whether the wave is giant.
2. The premise states that the boys are about to be hit by a wave, but it does not provide details about the wave's height or intensity, leaving the size of the wave unspecified.
3. The hypothesis introduces the idea of a "giant" wave, a detail that is not supported by any information in the premise.
4. The premise and hypothesis both discuss a wave approaching boys, but the hypothesis adds the notion of the wave being "giant," which is not mentioned in the premise.
5. The premise only indicates an approaching wave; it lacks any mention of the wave being particularly large or significant in size.
6. There is no evidence in the premise to suggest the wave's magnitude, so the characterization of the wave as "giant" in the hypothesis is unsupported.
7. The description in the premise does not include any adjectives or descriptors that would imply the wave's size, making the hypothesis's use of "giant" unsubstantiated.
8. The premise mentions the boys being about to be hit by a wave but does not qualify the wave as being large, thus not entailing the hypothesis.
