1. The size of the wave can be inferred from the context of four boys being affected, suggesting it is large enough to be considered giant.
2. Waves approaching the shore often increase in size and intensity, making it likely that an approaching wave is giant.
3. The term "giant wave" can be understood as a large wave capable of impacting multiple individuals, aligning with the scenario of four boys being hit.
4. Waves that are about to hit people are often described as giant due to their perceived threat and size.
5. The unpredictability and variability of wave sizes mean that any wave about to crash can be considered giant in comparison to the people it is about to hit.
6. An approaching wave that is close enough to hit four boys can logically be assumed to be large enough to be described as giant.
7. The common association of ocean waves with large, powerful movements supports the inference that an approaching wave is giant when it is about to crash.
8. Describing a wave as giant emphasizes its significance and potential impact, which is consistent with the scenario of it about to hit several boys.
9. Waves in oceanic environments are often large, and when they approach the shore, they can be perceived as giant due to their size and proximity.
10. Natural environments like the ocean often contain waves of varying sizes, and a wave impacting four children is likely substantial enough to be termed giant.
