1. The premise discusses the choir's singing and does not mention any structural details of the church, leaving the existence of ceiling cracks uncertain.
2. The term "church" in both the premise and hypothesis refers to the same place but does not imply anything about its physical condition.
3. The premise focuses on the activity of singing, which is unrelated to the architectural state of the church ceiling.
4. The hypothesis introduces new information about cracks, which is not addressed or contradicted by the premise.
5. The word "church" in the premise is used in a context of worship, while the hypothesis uses it in a context of structural integrity, which are different aspects.
6. The premise does not provide any information about the condition of the church, including the ceiling, so the hypothesis about cracks is neither confirmed nor denied.
7. The word "ceiling" does not appear in the premise, so its condition is outside the scope of the given information.
8. The semantic focus of the premise is on the choir and their actions, not on the physical attributes of the church building.
