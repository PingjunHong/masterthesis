1. "They" in the statement does not have a specific referent in the premise.
2. The premise does not specify what the hockey player is doing, so "They are playing hockey" cannot be inferred.
3. There is no clear link between "They" and "A hockey player in helmet" in terms of actions being performed.
4. The premise does not mention any activity, making the statement about playing hockey unresolvable.
5. "They" could refer to multiple hockey players or others, which is not clarified by the premise.
6. The premise describes only a single hockey player, not indicating a group, so "They" is ambiguous.
7. The action of playing hockey is not described or implied in the premise, leaving "They" without a clear antecedent.
8. "They" implies plural subjects, but the premise mentions only one player, which does not align clearly.
9. Without an action described in the premise, itâ€™s unclear if the person referred to by "They" is indeed playing hockey.
