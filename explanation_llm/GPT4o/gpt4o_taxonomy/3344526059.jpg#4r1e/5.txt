1. The premise only mentions a hockey player in a helmet, but does not explicitly state that they are playing hockey.
2. Wearing a helmet does not necessarily mean the hockey player is currently engaged in a game; they could be resting or practicing drills.
3. The presence of a hockey helmet suggests the person is prepared for hockey, but it does not confirm ongoing play.
4. The premise lacks any mention of a hockey game, rink, puck, or other players, so we cannot assume the hockey player is playing.
5. The hypothesis introduces the action of playing hockey, which is not specified or supported by the premise.
