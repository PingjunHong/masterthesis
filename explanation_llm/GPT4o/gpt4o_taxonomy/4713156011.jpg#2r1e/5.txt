1. The premise mentions a man flinging himself over a pole, but it doesn't specify that he is in the air, just that he is over the pole.
2. The premise does not mention the man being airborne; he could be closer to the ground or already landed.
3. The action of flinging over a pole could involve being in the air, but the premise does not explicitly confirm this.

5. The background details of people and canopies do not provide evidence of the man being airborne.
6. The premise describes a pole as part of the scene, but does not specify the height or position of the man relative to the pole, so being "in the air" is not confirmed.

8. The statement assumes an action (being hurled in the air) that is not directly supported by the premise's description.
9. The premise details the man's movement over a pole but does not support the hypothesis's implication of aerial trajectory.
10. The hypothesis assumes the man is airborne, but the premise does not provide explicit evidence of this.
