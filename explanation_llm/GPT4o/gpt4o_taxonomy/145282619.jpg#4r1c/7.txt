- Cooking and raking the yard are two different activities that cannot be done simultaneously.
- A person cannot be in two places at once, cooking over flames and raking a yard.
- Cooking typically requires being in a kitchen or near a stove, while raking is done in a yard.
- The tools used for cooking and raking are different; cooking uses kitchen utensils, while raking uses a rake.
- High flames are associated with cooking, not yard work like raking.
- Raking involves removing leaves or debris, whereas cooking involves preparing food.
- The context of being near high flames suggests a kitchen environment, not a yard.
- The physical posture and actions in cooking differ from those in raking.
- Safety considerations would prevent someone from cooking and raking at the same time due to the need for attention to high flames.
- Cooking requires attention to food and heat, which is incompatible with the focus needed for raking leaves.
