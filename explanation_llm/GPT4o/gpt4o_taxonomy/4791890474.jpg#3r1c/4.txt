1. Posing in front of an advertisement implies being stationary, while walking by an advertisement implies movement, which is contradictory.
2. The premise specifies an old man with a package, while the hypothesis refers to a man without any specific characteristics, creating a contradiction in specificity.
3. The action of posing suggests a deliberate stop or pause, conflicting with the continuous action of walking described in the hypothesis.
4. The premise involves interaction with the advertisement by posing, whereas the hypothesis involves merely passing by, indicating different levels of engagement with the advertisement.
5. The concept of posing involves standing still, which contradicts the action of walking, as the two actions cannot occur simultaneously.
