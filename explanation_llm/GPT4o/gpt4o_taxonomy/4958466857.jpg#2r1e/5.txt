1. The premise mentions that the dog is sleeping, but the hypothesis does not include this detail, which could indicate that the dog is awake or engaged in some activity.
2. The premise specifies the dog is on a purple leash, while the hypothesis omits any mention of the leash, implying the dog might not be restrained.
