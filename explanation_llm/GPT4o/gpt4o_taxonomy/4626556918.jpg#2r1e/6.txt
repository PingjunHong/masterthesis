1. The premise specifies an "outdoor skateboard park," while the statement generalizes this to a "park," creating a potential location conflict if interpreted as a non-skateboard park.
2. The premise describes the park as a "skateboard park," whereas the statement uses "a park to skateboard," which might imply a generic park rather than one specifically designed for skateboarding, leading to a structural logical exclusivity.
3. The phrase "a park to skateboard" suggests the purpose or intended use, which matches the premise that describes the location as a "skateboard park," resolving any potential location conflict.
4. The premise mentions "a young man," and the statement uses "a guy," which both refer to the same gender, thus avoiding gender conflict and supporting entailment.
5. The premise describes the man as "carrying a skateboard," and the statement's "a guy with a skateboard" maintains consistency, avoiding quantifier conflict.
6. The premise uses "looks at an outdoor skateboard park," and the statement's "looking at a park to skateboard" maintains temporal consistency, as both actions occur simultaneously.
7. The term "young man" in the premise and "guy" in the statement refer to the same individual, avoiding any gender conflict.
8. The premise and statement both involve a singular individual, preventing any potential quantifier conflict.
