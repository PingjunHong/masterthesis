1. A boy cannot be both actively using scissors and sleeping at the same time, as these actions are mutually exclusive.
2. The act of cutting something requires the boy to be awake and alert, which contradicts the state of being asleep.
3. Sleeping involves inactivity and unconsciousness, whereas using scissors requires active engagement and focus.
4. The physical movement and coordination needed to use scissors are not possible while a person is asleep.
5. The premise describes an action that necessitates being awake, which contradicts the state of being asleep as described in the hypothesis.
6. A person cannot perform a task involving fine motor skills, such as using scissors, if they are asleep.
7. Real-world knowledge dictates that sleep prevents any simultaneous engagement in other activities like cutting.
8. The state of sleep inherently means lack of awareness and movement, which is incompatible with the premise's depiction of activity.
9. A child using scissors is engaged in a task, which directly opposes the inactivity associated with sleep.
10. Being asleep would prevent the boy from performing any actions, such as using scissors, mentioned in the premise.
