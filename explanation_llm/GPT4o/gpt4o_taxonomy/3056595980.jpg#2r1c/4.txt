1. If the women are sitting on a bench looking out at the coast, they are not looking into the forest.
2. Sitting on a bench and looking at the coast implies a view directed towards the ocean or sea, which is contradictory to looking into the forest.
3. The act of looking out at the coast logically excludes the possibility of concurrently looking into the forest.
4. The coast is a geographical feature characterized by water and open space, whereas a forest is characterized by trees, making the two views mutually exclusive.
5. The spatial orientation of looking towards the coast inherently contradicts the spatial orientation of looking into the forest.
6. The semantic meaning of "coast" involves an expanse of water, which pragmatically differs from the dense nature of a forest, indicating contradictory directions of gaze.
7. Observing the coast suggests an unobstructed view of the horizon, whereas looking into the forest implies a view obstructed by trees, presenting a contradiction in perspective.
