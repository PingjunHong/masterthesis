1. The coast is typically associated with water and open views, not forests, so the women cannot be looking into the forest while sitting on the bench facing the coast.
2. The setting described as "looking out at the coast" implies the women have a clear view of the ocean or sea, which is different from being surrounded by or looking into the forest.
3. A bench facing the coast suggests a seaside or waterfront area, which is typically devoid of dense forest scenery.
4. The term "coast" indicates an area adjacent to the ocean or sea, while a forest is a heavily wooded area; the two are distinct and do not overlap in typical environments.
5. Being seated on a bench looking at the coast means they are observing a marine landscape, which is incompatible with the visual characteristics of a forest environment.
6. Coastal areas are defined by their proximity to large bodies of water, whereas forests are characterized by extensive tree cover and are usually located inland.
7. The act of looking out at the coast suggests an open, unobstructed view of the water, which is the opposite of the dense, tree-filled view characteristic of a forest.
