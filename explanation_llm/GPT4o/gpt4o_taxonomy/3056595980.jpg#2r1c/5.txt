- The premise mentions three women looking out at the coast, but it doesn't specify they are looking into a forest, which contradicts the hypothesis.
- The direction the women are looking at in the premise is towards the coast, not a forest, which results in a contradiction.
- The premise does not mention the presence of a forest; hence, the hypothesis introduces unsupported information.
- There is no mention of a forest in the premise, which contradicts the hypothesis that the women are looking into one.
- The premise specifies the setting as coastal, which inherently contrasts with the forest setting introduced in the hypothesis.
- The statement about the women looking into a forest lacks any supporting evidence from the premise.
- The geographical setting in the premise is coastal, which is not aligned with the forest setting described in the hypothesis.
- The hypothesis asserts the presence of a forest, which is absent from the premise, creating a contradiction.
- The premise describes a coastal view, while the hypothesis inaccurately suggests a forest view.
