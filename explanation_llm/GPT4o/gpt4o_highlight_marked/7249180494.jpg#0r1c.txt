1. "Spits" contradicts "eating" because spitting involves expelling something from the mouth, while eating involves consuming something.
2. "Water" contradicts "toasted marshmallow" because the swimmer is interacting with water, not a toasted marshmallow.
3. The absence of a "toasted marshmallow" in the content contradicts its mention in the statement.
4. The context of "grabbing the hand of someone helping him back to land" implies a rescue scenario, which contradicts the casual act of "eating a toasted marshmallow."
5. The active scenario involving swimming and spitting water is inconsistent with the leisure activity of eating a toasted marshmallow.
6. "A toasted marshmallow" is a specific food item not present or mentioned in the content, creating a direct conflict.
