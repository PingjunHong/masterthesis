1. The content does not specify whether the flight attendant is **standing** or in any other position while demonstrating the life vest usage.
2. The statement mentions a flight attendant **standing**, but the content does not provide details about the flight attendant's posture.
3. Demonstrating life vest usage does not inherently require the flight attendant to be **standing**, so the action could occur in various positions.
4. The content highlights the activity of demonstrating a life vest, not the physical posture of the flight attendant.
5. The statement assumes the flight attendant is **standing**, but this detail is neither confirmed nor denied by the content.
6. The content and statement can coexist without contradiction since posture is not explicitly addressed in the content.
7. The highlighted action of **standing** in the statement is unrelated to the explicitly stated action of demonstrating life vest usage in the content.
8. The content focuses on the flight attendant's uniform and actions, while the statement adds the detail of **standing**, which is not addressed in the content.
