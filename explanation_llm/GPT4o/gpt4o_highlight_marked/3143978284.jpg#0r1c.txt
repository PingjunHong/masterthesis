1. A baby wearing an orange and **brown** dress contradicts the statement that the baby is **nude** because being nude means not wearing any clothes, while wearing a dress indicates the baby is clothed.
2. The presence of a dress, specifically described as orange and **brown**, directly opposes the claim of the baby being **nude**, as clothing and nudity are mutually exclusive.
3. The description of the baby wearing a dress suggests coverage and adornment, which is inconsistent with the concept of being **nude**, implying a lack of clothing.
