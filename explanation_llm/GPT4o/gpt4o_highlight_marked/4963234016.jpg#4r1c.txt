1. "Working" and "sleeping" are mutually exclusive activities that cannot occur simultaneously.
2. "Long hours" implies an extended period of work, which contradicts the act of "sleeping."
3. The context of "working" suggests active engagement, which directly opposes the passive state of "sleeping."
4. The temporal overlap between "long hours" of work and "sleeping" creates an inconsistency in the timeline.
