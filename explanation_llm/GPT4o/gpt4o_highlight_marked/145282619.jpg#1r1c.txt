1. **Fire** contradicts **ovens**, as fire implies direct flame or open heat source, while ovens are enclosed appliances that heat food indirectly.
2. **5 pots** contradicts **bunch of ovens**, as pots are cookware used on open flames or stovetops, whereas ovens are separate appliances not directly involving pots.
3. **5** contradicts **bunch**, as "5" specifies an exact number, while "bunch" is vague and implies an indefinite group, typically larger than five.
