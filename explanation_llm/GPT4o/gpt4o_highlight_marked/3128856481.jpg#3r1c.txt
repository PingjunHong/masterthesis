1. **Expanding** contradicts **sleeps**, as expanding wings implies active movement, whereas sleeping implies inactivity.
2. **Its wings** contradicts **sleeps**, as wings in motion conflict with the stillness associated with sleep.
3. **In** contradicts **on top of**, as being "in the water" implies partial or full submersion, whereas "on top of the water" implies floating on the surface.
4. **The water** contradicts **floating on top of the water**, as the former suggests an immersive interaction, while the latter suggests staying above the water without immersion.
5. **Duck** contradicts **expanding its wings**, as the sleeping duck would not perform an action like spreading its wings.
