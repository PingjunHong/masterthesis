1. "Standing **behind**" indicates the child is positioned behind the other child, whereas "standing **on top**" implies the child is physically on top of the other child, which contradicts their spatial relationship.
2. The position "standing **behind**" and "standing **on top**" describe mutually exclusive physical locations that cannot coexist.
3. "Behind" and "on top" represent different relative positions, making it impossible for both to be true simultaneously.
4. The child in the content is described as standing in a location that does not involve physical contact with the blond-headed child, while the statement implies direct physical contact by standing "on top."
