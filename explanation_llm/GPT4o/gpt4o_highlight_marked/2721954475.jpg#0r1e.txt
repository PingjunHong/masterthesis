1. The statement does not specify the **location** of where the people are standing, while the content mentions they are near and on a large black square.
2. The statement only refers to the **action** "stand," which is consistent with the content but does not elaborate on the context of the black square or yellow writing, leaving room for ambiguity.
3. The statement does not mention the **size** or **color** of the square or the presence of yellow writing, which are included in the content but are not required for the action of standing.
4. The statement generalizes the **scene** by focusing only on the people standing, without addressing the specific environmental details provided in the content.
5. The statement lacks any reference to **proximity** (e.g., "near" or "on"), which is described in the content, making it unclear if the two are describing the exact same scenario.
6. The statement does not specify whether the action of standing is **static** or **dynamic**, which may or may not align with the content's description of people near and on the square.
