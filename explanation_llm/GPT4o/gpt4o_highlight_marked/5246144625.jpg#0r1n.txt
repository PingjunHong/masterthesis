1. The description of the cameras being disposable does not inherently imply that they are cheap, as disposability and cost are not directly correlated.
2. The term "cheap" is subjective and can vary based on personal perception or context, and the statement does not provide enough information about the price or quality of the cameras to confirm they are cheap.
3. The focus in the content is on the girls looking at the cameras, not the price or value of the cameras, leaving the cost unspecified.
4. The content does not include any indicators of the cameras' price, such as brand, store, or pricing information, so the assumption that they are cheap is not supported by the provided details.
5. The statement about the cameras being cheap does not contradict the content, but neither does the content support this claim, making it neutral with respect to the cameras' cost.
