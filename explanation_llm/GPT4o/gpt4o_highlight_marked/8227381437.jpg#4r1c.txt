1. A shoemaker being described as "old" contradicts the idea of someone preparing for their "16th" birthday, as "old" typically implies advanced age, not adolescence.
2. A "16th" birthday implies that the shoemaker is a teenager, which directly contradicts the description of being "old."
3. The concept of a "shoemaker" generally refers to an adult profession, which is inconsistent with the idea of someone who is 16 years old.
4. The word "old" suggests someone who has lived for a long time, which does not align with being a teenager preparing for a 16th birthday.
5. The act of working in a factory as a shoemaker implies adulthood, which conflicts with the implication of being 16 years old.
6. The combination of "old" and "16th birthday" creates a temporal impossibility, as someone cannot simultaneously be described as old and be only 16 years old.
