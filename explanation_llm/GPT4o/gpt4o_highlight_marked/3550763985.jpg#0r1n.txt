- "New season" does not specify whether it is related to winter, spring, or any other season, which means it doesn't directly connect to the snowy day mentioned in the content.
- The term "preparing" indicates an action that might not be directly observable from the image; the content describes the skateboarder at the top of a jump, which doesn't necessarily imply preparation.
- "Season" could refer to any time period, such as a sports season or a fashion season, which is not explicitly linked to the snowy setting described in the content.
- The content is focused on a specific moment during a jump, while the statement suggests an ongoing process or future event ("preparing"), which is not necessarily evident from the image.
- The statement's use of "new season" could imply a future event, while the content is describing a current situation (a jump on a snowy day), leaving the relationship between the two ambiguous.
- The reference to "season" does not specify any sport or activity, whereas the content implies a skateboarding activity, which leaves the type of season unclear.
