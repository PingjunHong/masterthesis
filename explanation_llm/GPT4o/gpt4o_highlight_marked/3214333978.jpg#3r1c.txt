1. "Icy" and "dry" describe mutually exclusive conditions, as an icy road cannot simultaneously be dry.
2. The "icy road" and the "dry highway" refer to different physical surfaces, which cannot be the same location.
3. Walking "down" a road and walking "near" a highway imply different spatial relationships to the path.
