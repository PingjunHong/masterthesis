1. The content does not specify the exact height, such as "5000 feet," and thus the statement cannot be confirmed or denied.
2. The content mentions "gray rocks high above some green foliage," but it does not quantify the height, leaving open the possibility of "5000 feet."
3. The term "pulls himself up" in the statement aligns with "pulling himself up" in the content, but the content lacks details about the distance climbed.
4. The phrase "high above some green foliage" in the content is consistent with "over a forest" in the statement, but "forest" is a broader interpretation of "green foliage."

6. The statement's use of "5000 feet" is a specific measurement not addressed in the content, making it unverifiable.
