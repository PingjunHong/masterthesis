1. The content does not explicitly mention that the swimmer **drowned** or came close to drowning, only that they were spitting water and being helped back to land.
2. The highlighted term **drowned** introduces an assumption about the swimmer's condition that is not directly supported or contradicted by the content.
3. The content does not describe the presence of a **fast current** or any specific cause for the swimmer's situation, leaving room for alternative explanations.
4. The content focuses on the swimmer's observable actions (spitting water, being helped) without providing details about the severity or cause of their distress, making the highlighted term **drowned** speculative.
5. The statement introduces additional context (e.g., "sucked under a fast current") that is not mentioned in the content, so there is no definitive connection to confirm or deny the claim.
6. The highlighted term **drowned** implies a near-fatal event, but the content does not include information to suggest the swimmer was in such a critical condition.
7. The content describes a helping action, but it does not specify the reason for assistance, leaving the possibility that the swimmer was not in life-threatening danger.
8. The content does not confirm that the swimmer was affected by external forces such as a **fast current**, making the statement an inference that cannot be verified.
9. The highlighted term **drowned** adds an emotional or dramatic connotation that is absent from the neutral depiction of events in the content.
10. The lack of explicit causation or severity in the content makes it impossible to conclude whether or not the swimmer almost **drowned**, rendering the statement neutral.
