1. The content does not specify that the hockey player is actively **playing** hockey; they could be doing something else while wearing the helmet, such as resting or preparing.
2. The presence of a hockey helmet does not guarantee the action of **playing** hockey, as it could be worn for other activities or purposes related to hockey or unrelated.
3. The content only describes the person as "a hockey player in helmet" without indicating any action, leaving the possibility open that they are not currently **playing** hockey.
4. The content does not provide temporal context to confirm that the person is **playing** hockey at the moment; the description could refer to a different situation or time.
5. The content does not explicitly mention the activity being performed, so the assumption that they are **playing** hockey cannot be confirmed or contradicted.
