2. The term "gold" is not mentioned or implied in the content, leaving the motivation for digging open to interpretation.
3. The activity of digging is described in both sentences, but the content does not specify what is being sought, making the statement neither confirmed nor contradicted.
4. The woman's intent or goal in digging is not addressed in the content, allowing for multiple possible explanations, including searching for gold.
