1. "Walking" contradicts "laying," as these are incompatible actions.
2. "Out of the water" contradicts "on the beach," as the locations are different.
3. "In the black wetsuit" implies being dressed for water activities, which is inconsistent with "laying on the beach."
4. The action described in "walking out of the water" implies movement, whereas "laying on the beach" indicates a stationary position.
