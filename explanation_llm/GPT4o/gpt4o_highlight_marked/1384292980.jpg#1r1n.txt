1. The content does not specify the **destination** of the girls, so it is unclear if they were heading **to** **the** **park**.
2. The statement uses the word **"going"**, which implies movement toward a destination, but the content only describes the act of walking without indicating their intent or purpose.
3. The content does not mention **"the park"**, so there is no evidence confirming or denying that the girls were heading there.
4. The direction or purpose of the girls' walking in the content is unspecified, making it impossible to determine if they were going **to** **the** **park**.
5. The content and the statement are consistent in describing movement, but the specific destination, **"the park,"** is not addressed in the content.
6. The act of walking in the content could be random or purposeless, whereas the statement assumes a specific goal, **"the park."**
7. The content allows for multiple possible destinations, and **"the park"** is only one of many possibilities.
8. The content does not provide temporal or contextual details that could confirm the statement's assumption of where the girls were going.
9. The phrase **"to the park"** introduces additional information not mentioned or contradicted in the original content.
10. The content describes an action that is neutral and open-ended, while the statement imposes a specific context (**"the park"**) that is neither confirmed nor denied.
