1. "Working" in the content directly aligns with "working" in the statement, indicating the woman is engaged in an activity.
2. The removal of "long hours" in the statement does not negate the fact that the woman is working; it simplifies the description without altering the meaning.
3. The statement focuses on the core action "working," which is explicitly present in the content.
4. The qualifier "long hours" is additional detail and not necessary for the truth of the statement "A woman is working."
5. Both the content and the statement describe the same subject (a woman) performing the same action (working), even if the content provides more specific details.
6. The entailment holds because the statement is a less specific version of the content while preserving the essential meaning.
