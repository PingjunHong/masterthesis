- The **color** "white and red" in the content contradicts the **color** "black" in the statement.
- The **phrase** "only white and red" in the content excludes the possibility of wearing **black**, leading to a contradiction.
- The **presence** of two colors ("white and red") in the content conflicts with the **single color** ("black") mentioned in the statement.
