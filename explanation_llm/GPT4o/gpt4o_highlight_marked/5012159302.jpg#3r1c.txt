2. The content indicates that the equipment is being **pulled** **by** two **horses**, while the statement claims it is **pulled** **by** **sheep**, which are different animals and thus contradictory.
3. **Horses** are strong and typically used to pull heavy farm equipment, whereas **sheep** are not used for pulling such equipment, creating a contradiction between the content and the statement.
4. The number of animals pulling the equipment differs between the content and the statement, as the content specifies two **horses** while the statement does not specify a number and mentions **sheep**.
