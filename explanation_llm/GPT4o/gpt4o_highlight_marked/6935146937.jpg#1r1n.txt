1. A **black** man cannot simultaneously be **Asian**, as the races are mutually exclusive.
2. The statement specifies the man is **Asian**, which contradicts the description of him being **black**.
3. The content explicitly identifies the individual as a **black** man, which precludes the possibility of him being **Asian**.
4. Being **black** and being **Asian** are distinct racial categories; the man cannot belong to both.
5. The description of the man as **black** directly opposes the claim that he is **Asian**, creating a contradiction.
