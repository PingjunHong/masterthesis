3. **Running** implies physical movement, while **eating** requires stationary behavior, creating a contradiction.
4. The state of the **dogs** being **running** contradicts the state of them being **eating**.
5. **Eating** necessitates engagement with food, which is incompatible with the action of **running** described for the **dogs**.
6. The description of the **dogs** does not include any indication of food or consumption, contradicting the idea that they are **eating**.
