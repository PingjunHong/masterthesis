2. Being **homeless** implies not having a home, which is the opposite of **owning homes**.
3. The description of the men as **homeless** negates the possibility of them **owning homes**, creating a logical inconsistency.
4. The term **homeless** inherently conflicts with the concept of **home ownership** as presented in the statement.
