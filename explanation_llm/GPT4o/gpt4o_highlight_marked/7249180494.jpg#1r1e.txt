1. "Man" refers to a "person," as "man" is a subset of the broader category "person."
2. "The black wetsuit" is additional descriptive information that does not contradict the statement, as it does not negate the fact that the subject is a person.
3. "In the black wetsuit" provides context about the person's attire, which is irrelevant to the entailment of the action described.
4. "The" in "the man" specifies a particular person, but the statement generalizes it to "a person," which is logically valid.
5. "Walking out of the water" in both the content and statement describes the same action, ensuring compatibility.
6. The specificity of "the man in the black wetsuit" is preserved when generalized to the broader category of "a person."
