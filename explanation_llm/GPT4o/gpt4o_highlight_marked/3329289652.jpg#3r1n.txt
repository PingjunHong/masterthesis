1. The content does not specify whether the boys are playing **inside** or **outside**.
2. The location of the activity is not mentioned in the content, leaving the possibility of the boys being **outside** open.
3. Playing with Legos can occur both **outside** and **inside**, so the content does not confirm or deny the statement.
4. The content focuses on the activity of playing with Legos, but it does not provide any information about the **outside** setting.
5. The content and the statement are compatible because the location (**outside**) is not explicitly addressed or contradicted.
