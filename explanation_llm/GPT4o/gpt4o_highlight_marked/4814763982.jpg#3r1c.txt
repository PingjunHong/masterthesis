- **"Performing"** contradicts **"throws"** because performing suggests an ongoing activity, whereas throwing implies a single action.
- **"With"** contradicts **"in the air"** because "with" implies the baton is part of the performance, while "in the air" suggests a dynamic motion involving a different object.
- **"A baton"** contradicts **"a banana"** because the objects mentioned are entirely different in nature.
