- "Bald" contradicts "long-haired" because a person cannot simultaneously have no hair and long hair.
- "Older women" contradicts "young women" because a person cannot simultaneously be old and young.
- The presence of a comma (",") in the first phrase suggests separation, while the hyphen ("-") in "long-haired" indicates a compound adjective, but these structural differences are irrelevant to the core contradiction.
