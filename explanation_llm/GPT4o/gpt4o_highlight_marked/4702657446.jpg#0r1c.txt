1. The content mentions a "young **woman**," which implies that someone is present, contradicting the statement that "**nobody**" is drying clothes.
2. The phrase "is putting her clothes in the dryer" in the content directly contradicts the statement that "**nobody**" is engaged in drying clothes.
3. The presence of a subject actively interacting with the dryer ("**woman** is putting her clothes in the dryer") contradicts the claim that "**nobody**" is performing such an action.
4. The use of "drying clothes" in the statement is negated by the content, which explicitly describes the process of drying being initiated by the **woman**.
5. The existence of an individual performing an action in the content ("young **woman**") inherently contradicts the statement that there is "**nobody**" involved.
