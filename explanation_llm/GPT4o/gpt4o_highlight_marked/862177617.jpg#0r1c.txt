1. "Stands" contradicts "dancing" because standing implies being stationary, whereas dancing involves active movement.
2. "Outdoors in a crowd" contradicts "singing" because the description does not mention any activity related to singing or performing.
3. "Hood on" contradicts "singing" because wearing a hood may imply a passive or casual demeanor, which contrasts with the active and expressive act of singing.
4. "Stands" contradicts "and singing" because the statement describes a person who is stationary, not actively engaged in expressive actions like singing.
