3. The presence of "bike" in the content and "horse" in the statement causes a direct conflict in what is being described.
4. The action "riding" cannot apply to both a "bike" and a "horse" at the same time in the given context, as they are mutually exclusive.
5. The identical subject "man" performing the same action "riding" on two distinct objects ("bike" and "horse") creates a contradiction.
6. The indefinite article "a" before "bike" and "horse" indicates singularity, making it impossible for the man to be riding both simultaneously.
