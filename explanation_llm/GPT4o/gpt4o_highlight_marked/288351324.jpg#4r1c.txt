- A "group" implies multiple people, which contradicts "no one" indicating zero participants.
- "Dancing together" suggests active participation in dancing, which conflicts with "no one is dancing."
- The presence of a "group of people" inherently negates the claim that "no one" is present or dancing.
- The word "together" implies collective action, which contradicts the solitary absence implied by "no one."
- Observing a "group" dancing contradicts the assertion that "no one" is engaged in dancing.
