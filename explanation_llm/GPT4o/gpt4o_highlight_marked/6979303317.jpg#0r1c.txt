1. "Looking at the camera" contradicts "sleeping," as individuals looking at the camera are awake and conscious.
2. "Resting against the pipe bed on the truck" contradicts "in a tent," as the location described is a truck, not a tent.
3. "Holding pipes" and "holding a large object above his head" contradict "sleeping," as these actions indicate activity rather than rest or sleep.
