1. The action of closing in on prey does not necessarily indicate the lioness's hunger level, as it might be driven by instinct or territorial behavior.
2. A lioness might close in on prey for reasons other than hunger, such as training her cubs or asserting dominance over an area.
3. The term "hungry" implies a specific state of need or desire for food, which is not directly stated or implied by merely closing in on prey.
4. Even if the lioness is engaging in hunting behavior, it doesn't confirm her current state of hunger; she might be motivated by other factors such as instinct or opportunity.
5. The presence of prey could trigger a hunting response regardless of the lioness's hunger status, as hunting can be part of natural behavior irrespective of immediate need for food.
