1. **Walk** and **picking** describe fundamentally different actions; walking implies movement, while picking implies gathering or collecting something.
2. **Down** and **berries** conflict because walking down a sidewalk does not involve activities related to berry-picking.
3. **Sidewalk** and **countryside** are contradictory, as a sidewalk is an urban or suburban feature, while the countryside is a rural setting.
4. A **busy street** in a **downtown area** contrasts with the **countryside**, which is typically quiet and natural rather than urban and bustling.
