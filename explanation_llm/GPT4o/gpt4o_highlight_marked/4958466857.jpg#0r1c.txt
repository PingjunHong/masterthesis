1. The content specifies that the men are using a cardboard **sign**, but the statement claims the **dog** created it, which contradicts the content.
2. The content does not mention anything about the **dog** being involved in creating or writing the sign, while the statement attributes the creation of the sign to the **dog**, creating a contradiction.
3. The content implies the **sign** is already present and being used, whereas the statement introduces the implausible scenario of the **dog** writing the sign.
4. The statement assumes the men convinced their **dog** to **write**, which is contradictory because dogs cannot write, and there is no evidence in the content to suggest otherwise.
5. The content focuses on the men and their **sign**, but the statement shifts the focus to the **dog**'s alleged writing ability, contradicting the original scenario.
6. The content does not describe the men as **illiterate**, while the statement explicitly claims they are, creating a contradiction.
7. The act of the **dog** writing the sign, as suggested by the statement, is inconsistent with the realistic and straightforward description in the content.
