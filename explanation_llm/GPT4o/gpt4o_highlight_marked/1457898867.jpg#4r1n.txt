1. The content mentions a boy riding, but it does not specify whether he is riding a **horse** or another object, so the type of transportation is ambiguous.
2. The statement introduces the concept of a **horse**, but this detail is not confirmed or contradicted by the content.
3. The content describes a road, while the statement uses "by," leaving the relationship between the boy, the **horse**, and the cows open to interpretation.
4. The content's "riding down the road" and the statement's "rides a **horse**" are not inherently contradictory but lack sufficient overlap to be entailed.
5. The content does not explicitly mention or exclude the presence of a **horse**, so the statement could be true or false depending on unstated details.
6. The focus of the content is on the presence of the boy and the cows, while the statement adds new information about the **horse**, which is neither supported nor denied.
