1. "Dogs" are a subset of "animals," so the mention of dogs implies the presence of animals.
2. The phrase "take a nap" means the dogs are asleep, satisfying the condition of some animals being asleep.
3. The quantifier "some" is satisfied because at least one dog is asleep, and dogs are animals.
4. The indefinite article "a" in "a bunch of dogs" indicates a group of animals, which includes at least one dog, and some are asleep.
