1. "Flung" indicates a sudden or forceful movement, whereas "running" suggests continuous motion, making the actions contradictory.
2. "Himself" implies the man acted on his own body, while "after" implies pursuing someone else.
3. The context of "flung himself over a pole" suggests an acrobatic or static scene, incompatible with "running after" someone.
4. The presence of "a pole" and "people and canopies in the background" suggests a recreational or athletic scenario, not a chase involving a "robber."
5. The word "robber" introduces a criminal context, which is inconsistent with the described environment of "people and canopies."
6. The described motion of flinging does not align with the purposeful, goal-oriented action of running after someone.
7. The subject's focus seems to be on his own movement ("flung himself"), not on the pursuit of another individual like a robber.
8. A pole is a stationary object that suggests a specific activity (e.g., gymnastics or sports), which conflicts with the dynamic pursuit implied in running after a robber.
