1. The term **black man** entails a **man**, as "black" specifies additional detail but does not negate the fact that the person is a man.
2. The **down jacket** is a specific type of **jacket**, so the more general term "jacket" is entailed by the more specific term "down jacket."
3. The act of **holding a pink comb** entails **holding a comb**, as the color "pink" is an additional detail but does not contradict the general action of holding a comb.
4. The description of "arms spread" is not mentioned in the statement, but its omission does not contradict the entailment, as it is not essential to the described action.
5. The statement simplifies the original content without introducing any conflicting information, which preserves entailment.
