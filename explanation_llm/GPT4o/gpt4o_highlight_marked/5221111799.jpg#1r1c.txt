1. **"Working"** and **"jumping"** describe fundamentally different actions and cannot occur simultaneously as described in the context.
2. A **"carpenter"** and a **"boy"** are distinct entities, and the statement implies they are the same individual, which is contradictory.
3. The **"carpenter working on a roof"** and the **"boy jumping up and down"** imply entirely different activities and roles, creating a contradiction.
4. The setting of **"working on a roof at a house being built"** is incompatible with the action of **"jumping up and down"**, as these actions would not logically occur in the same context.
