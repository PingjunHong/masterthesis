- "**Walk**" involves physical movement, while "**eating**" refers to consuming food, which are mutually exclusive actions.
- The location "**side of a bridge**" is different from "**in a kitchen**," indicating two distinct settings.
- Walking typically occurs outdoors or in open areas like a bridge, whereas eating spaghetti in a kitchen implies an indoor activity.
- The activity of walking does not involve food, whereas eating spaghetti explicitly involves food consumption.
- The context of moving along a bridge is incompatible with the focused act of eating spaghetti in a kitchen.
