1. The man could be using the telescope to observe something other than stars, such as planets, the moon, or distant objects on Earth.
2. The statement does not specify what the man is observing, so it cannot be assumed to be stars.
3. The man might be setting up or adjusting the telescope rather than actively watching stars.
4. The activity may take place during the day, making it unlikely for the man to be observing stars.

6. The content does not provide any evidence to confirm that stars are the subject of observation.

8. The man might intend to watch stars later but is not doing so at the moment described.
9. The telescope lens could be obstructed or pointed at something other than the sky.
10. The context does not clarify whether the man has access to a view of the stars.
