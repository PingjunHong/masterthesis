1. The bird in the content is not explicitly identified as a duck, so it could be a different type of bird.
2. Flapping wings on water does not necessarily imply swimming, as the bird might just be stationary or taking off.
3. The content does not specify the location as a lake, so the bird might be on a different body of water.
4. The content does not confirm whether the bird is actively moving in water, while the statement assumes swimming.
5. The content lacks any mention of a duck or specific species, creating uncertainty about the species of the bird.
6. The content does not indicate the presence of a lake, leaving open the possibility that the bird is on another type of water body, such as a pond or river.
7. The action of flapping wings does not necessarily correlate with swimming; the bird could be preparing to fly.
8. The content and statement describe different actions and contexts, with no direct contradiction or entailment.
