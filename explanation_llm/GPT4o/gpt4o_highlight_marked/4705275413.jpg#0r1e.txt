1. **"A group of four children"** aligns with **"Four kids"** as both refer to the same quantity and concept (children/kids).
2. **"pose"** is explicitly stated in both sentences, indicating the same action.
3. **"on a muddy beach"** entails **"on a beach"**, as a muddy beach is a specific type of beach.
4. The omission of **"smiling and making faces"** in the second statement does not contradict the first sentence, as it provides additional but non-essential details.
