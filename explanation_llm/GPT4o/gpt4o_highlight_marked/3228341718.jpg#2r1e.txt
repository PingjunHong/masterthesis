1. "3" in the content implies there is a specific number of ladies, which satisfies the statement that "there are ladies," as "3" is a subset of "some" or "any."
2. The word "ladies" is explicitly mentioned in both the content and the statement, ensuring consistency regarding the subject.
3. The action "running" is explicitly described in both the content and the statement, indicating that the activity is the same.
4. The presence of "numbers on their shirts" in the content provides additional detail but does not contradict the statement, as the statement does not specify this detail.
5. The phrase "There are" in the statement is a broad existential claim that is supported by the content's description of the activity involving "ladies."
