2. The content only mentions that the biker races, which does not imply or contradict the statement that the biker **loses**.
3. The highlighted word **loses** introduces a specific result that is not addressed in the content.
4. The content focuses on the act of racing, while the statement adds an additional detail about the **loss** that is not present in the content.
