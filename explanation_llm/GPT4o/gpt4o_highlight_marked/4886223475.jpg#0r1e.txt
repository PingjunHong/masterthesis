1. The action described in the content explicitly states that the man is "riding" a bike, which matches the action mentioned in the statement.
2. The content specifies that the object being ridden is a "bike," which directly corresponds to the bike referenced in the statement.
3. Though additional details are provided in the content (e.g., the man is touching his nose and wearing a tunic), these do not contradict the fact that the man is riding a bike.
4. The location and context (e.g., in front of a sandstone wall) are irrelevant to the core entailment of the man riding a bike.
