1. **"Naked"** contradicts **"in a suit"** because a person cannot simultaneously be unclothed and wearing a suit.
2. **"Man rides"** contradicts **"man walking"** because one cannot be riding a bike and walking at the same time.
3. **"A bike"** contradicts **"a sidewalk"** because riding a bike typically occurs on a bike path or street, not walking on a sidewalk.
