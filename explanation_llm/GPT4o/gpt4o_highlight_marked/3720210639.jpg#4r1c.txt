- "Midair" contradicts "lets it sit in the garage," as being in midair implies active use of the bicycle, not it being idle in a garage.
- "On" contradicts "lets it sit," as being on the bicycle implies riding it, not leaving it stationary.
- "Bicycle" contradicts "collect rust," as an actively used bicycle would not be left to rust in a garage.
- The boy's action of riding in midair contradicts "afraid to ride," as performing such an action would require confidence, not fear.
