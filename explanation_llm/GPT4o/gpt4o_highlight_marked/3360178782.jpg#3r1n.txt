- The term "men" in the statement specifies the gender of some individuals in the group, but the content does not specify gender, so the statement remains neutral.
- The use of "and" in the statement adds specificity by indicating the presence of both men and women, whereas the content simply refers to a "group of people," leaving gender unspecified.
- The description "fresh" in both the content and the statement maintains consistency; however, the statement specifies "romaine lettuce," while the content simply mentions "lettuce," resulting in a neutral relationship due to the added specificity without contradiction.
