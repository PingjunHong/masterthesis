1. "**Outside**" contradicts "**kitchen**" because the men cannot be in both locations simultaneously.
2. "**Chairs**" contradicts "**table**" because the men cannot be sitting on chairs with red seats while sitting at a kitchen table.
3. The men are described as sitting **outside**, which contradicts the statement that they are sitting **inside** in a kitchen.
4. "**Chairs**" and "**table**" suggest different seating arrangements, making the descriptions incompatible.
5. The setting "**outside**" inherently contradicts the setting "**kitchen**," as one is outdoors and the other indoors.
6. "**Chairs with red seats**" contradicts "**kitchen table**" because the furniture described in each situation is different.
