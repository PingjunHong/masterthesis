1. A **sweatshirt** and a **tank top** are distinct types of clothing and cannot be worn as the same outer layer simultaneously.
2. A **sweatshirt** typically covers more of the upper body, while a **tank top** exposes the shoulders and arms, making it contradictory for the man to be described as wearing both at once.
3. The description of the **sweatshirt** indicates a heavier, long-sleeved garment, which directly contradicts the lighter, sleeveless nature of a **tank top**.
4. The **sweatshirt** implies a casual, warm garment suitable for colder conditions, whereas a **tank top** is typically worn in warmer settings, creating a situational inconsistency.
