1. A **newlywed** couple implies they are recently married, which is incompatible with being **divorced**, as divorce signifies the end of a marriage.
2. The term **newlywed** suggests a current marital union, whereas **divorced** indicates that the marriage has already been dissolved.
3. Being **newlywed** and **divorced** are mutually exclusive states; one cannot be both simultaneously.
4. **Newlywed** describes a positive and ongoing marital status, while **divorced** indicates a terminated relationship.
5. The description of the couple as **newlywed** implies they are still in the early stages of marriage, making the claim of being **divorced** logically impossible.
