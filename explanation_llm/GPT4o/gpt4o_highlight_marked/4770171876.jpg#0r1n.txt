1. The content does not specify that the piece of playground equipment is a **swing**, so it is unclear if the boy is playing on the swings or some other equipment.
2. The content does not mention the **time of day**, so it is uncertain whether the boy is playing after school or at another time.
3. The content does not confirm that the boy is at school or has just finished school, making the mention of "after school" unverifiable.
4. The type of playground equipment in the content is not detailed, leaving the possibility open that it may not be **swings**.
5. The content does not explicitly describe the boy engaging in an activity specific to **swings**, such as swinging back and forth.
6. The content does not provide a context for when or why the boy is playing, so "after school" is neither supported nor contradicted.
