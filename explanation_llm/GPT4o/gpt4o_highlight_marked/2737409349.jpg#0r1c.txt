1. The **man** cannot be **sitting** and **pacing** simultaneously, as these are mutually exclusive physical states.
2. The description of the **man** being **sitting** conflicts with the statement that he is **pacing**, because sitting involves remaining stationary, while pacing involves movement.
3. The **sitting** action implies a calm or settled posture, whereas **pacing nervously** suggests restlessness and movement, creating a direct contradiction.
4. The **man** is explicitly described as **sitting** in the content, leaving no room for the possibility of him being **pacing** in the same moment.
