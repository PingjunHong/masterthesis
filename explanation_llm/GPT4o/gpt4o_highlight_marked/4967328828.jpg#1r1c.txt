- A colorful bikini and a prom dress are fundamentally different types of clothing.
- A bikini is typically used for swimming or sunbathing, while a prom dress is formal attire for special occasions.
- The description explicitly mentions the woman wearing a "colorful bikini," which cannot simultaneously be a "prom dress."
- The term "dress" refers to a single piece of clothing that covers the body, unlike a bikini, which is a two-piece garment.
- The context of resting by blue water aligns with beachwear like a bikini, not formal wear such as a prom dress.
