1. **Gymnasts** and **football players** represent different groups of athletes, so the subjects in the two statements are not the same.
2. The activity of "warming up" and "practicing" are different actions, which creates a contrast between the two statements.
3. The **content** specifies "female" gymnasts, while the **statement** makes no reference to gender, further separating the two contexts.
4. The setting of "before a competition" in the **content** is missing in the **statement**, suggesting a different scenario.
5. The mention of **gymnasts** in the **content** and **football players** in the **statement** points to entirely different sports, leading to contradiction in focus.
