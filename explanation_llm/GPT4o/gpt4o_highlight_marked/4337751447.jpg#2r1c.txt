1. **Homeless** contradicts **rich** because a person cannot simultaneously lack a home and possess significant wealth.
2. **Man** is consistent, so there is no contradiction in gender or identity.
3. The action of **pushing an overfilled plastic blue shopping cart** contradicts the description of **holding a Rolex**, as the former implies poverty or destitution, while the latter implies affluence and luxury.
4. A **homeless man** is unlikely to own or hold a **Rolex**, as it is an expensive item typically associated with wealth.
5. The combination of **homeless** and **rich** creates an inherent contradiction, as these terms describe mutually exclusive socioeconomic statuses.
