1. The driver is part of the group, and everyone in the group is described as wearing black shirts, which contradicts the claim that the driver is wearing a purple shirt.
2. The description "group of people wearing black shirts" implies uniformity in clothing, making it inconsistent for one member (the driver) to be wearing a purple shirt.
3. The statement about black shirts applies to all individuals in the group, including the driver, which conflicts with the driver being described as wearing purple.
4. The driver's shirt color (purple) directly contradicts the specified black shirt color of the group in the content.
