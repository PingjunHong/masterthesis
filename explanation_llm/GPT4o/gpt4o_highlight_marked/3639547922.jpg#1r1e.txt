1. "Slides" and "goes" both describe the action of moving smoothly; therefore, "slides down" entails "goes down."
2. "Down" in both sentences indicates the direction of movement, confirming the action described is consistent in both.
3. The presence of "a girl" in both sentences ensures the subject is the same, reinforcing the entailment.
4. The action of sliding is inherently a way of going, especially in the context of a slide.
5. The sentence implies a typical use of a slide, which is to go down it, making "slides down" entail "goes down."
6. The smiling aspect of the girl in the content does not conflict with the action described in the statement, supporting the entailment.
