1. The statement does not specify the exact timing of the father's work schedule, so the child could be playing with the boots at any time, not necessarily while he is at work.
2. The content does not mention the father's presence or absence, leaving open the possibility that he could be nearby or elsewhere, unrelated to his work status.
3. The action of playing with the boots is independent of the father's work status, so the relationship between the two activities is ambiguous.
4. The term "while" suggests simultaneous actions, but the content does not confirm or deny the father's location or activities, making it neutral.
5. The content focuses on the action of playing with boots, without any reference to the father's activities, making any link to "he is at work" speculative.
6. The emphasis on "he" and "is" at work introduces new information not present in the content, which does not address the father's current activities.
7. The statement introduces a specific context that is not necessary to understand or interpret the action described in the content.
