3. **Poses** indicates the man is actively engaging with the scene, while **walks** suggests he is merely passing through.
4. The man is **posing** for a photo or display, which is incompatible with the act of **walking**.
5. **Poses** aligns with a stationary activity, but **walks** describes a dynamic movement.
