1. "**Rolls down**" contradicts "**stares at**" because one implies motion while the other implies being stationary.
2. "**A hill**" with activity (a person riding a wagon) contradicts "**an empty hill**," as the hill cannot be both occupied and empty simultaneously.
3. "**Riding a wagon**" contradicts the absence of such action in "**stares at an empty hill**," where no wagon or riding is mentioned.
4. "**A person**" being active (rolling down the hill) contradicts the passive act of "**stares**" in the second statement.
5. The presence of "**another watches**" suggests a scene with multiple people, which contradicts the second statement's implication of solitude at an empty hill.
