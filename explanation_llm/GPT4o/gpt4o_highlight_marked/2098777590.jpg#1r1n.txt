1. The term "**person**" is used instead of specifying "elderly woman," so the statement does not confirm or contradict the specific identity of the individual.
2. The word "**dinner**" is more specific than "food," and the content does not indicate the meal being prepared is specifically dinner.
3. The content does not provide information about the time of day, so it cannot be inferred that the food being prepared is for dinner.
4. The content does not specify whether the woman is making food for herself, others, or for any particular purpose, leaving the notion of "dinner" ambiguous.
5. The term "**makes**" is consistent with "preparing food," but it does not clarify the exact meal or context, making the relationship neutral.
