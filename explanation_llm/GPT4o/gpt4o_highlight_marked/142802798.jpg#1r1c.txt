1. "Skateboard" in the content contradicts "rollerblading" in the statement because the modes of activity and equipment differ.
2. "On" in the content contradicts "through" in the statement because being on an object implies a stationary or balancing position, while moving through implies passing within or across a space.
3. "Stone wall" in the content contradicts "tunnel" in the statement because a stone wall is a solid, flat surface, whereas a tunnel is an enclosed or hollow structure for passage.
4. Graffiti on the "stone wall" in the content is inconsistent with the "tunnel" in the statement, as the described environments are distinct and suggest different settings.
